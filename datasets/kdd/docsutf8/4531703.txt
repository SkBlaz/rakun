Local decomposition for rare class analysis Given its importance, the problem of predicting rare classes in large-scale multi-labeled data sets has attracted great attentions in the literature. However, the rare-class problem remains a critical challenge, because there is no natural way developed for handling imbalanced class distributions. This paper thus fills this crucial void by developing a method for Classification using lOcal clusterinG (COG). Specifically, for a data set with an imbalanced class distribution, we perform clustering within each large class and produce sub-classes with relatively balanced sizes. Then, we apply traditional supervised learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), for classification. Indeed, our experimental results on various real-world data sets show that our method produces significantly higher prediction accuracies on rare classes than state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that COG can also improve the performance of traditional supervised learning algorithms on data sets with balanced class distributions.
