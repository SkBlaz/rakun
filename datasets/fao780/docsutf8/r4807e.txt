<title>ADCP/REP/85/22 - Nutritional Fish Pathology</title>
<section>1</section>
PREFACE
This report is based on the original lecture texts presented by Dr. A. G. J. Tacon, Fish Feed Technologist, Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP), to the trainees of the fourth senior aquaculturists' training course at the African Regional Aquaculture Centre (part of the UNDP/FAO ADCP Regional Aquaculture Centres) in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, from 5-8 October 1984.
The information contained within this report is a synthesis of published data from a wide variety of sources relating to the morphological signs of dietary nutrient deficiency and toxicity in fish and, as such, constitutes a useful reference source for persons or parties wishing to feed fish with a nutrient balanced diet under intensive farming conditions.

1. INTRODUCTION
In contrast to extensive and semi-intensive culture systems where fish obtain all or part of their nutrient needs from naturally available food organisms, fish maintained under intensive culture systems rely totally on the provision of a nutritionally complete diet throughout their culture cycle. For many farmed fish species the development of complete artificial rations (for use within intensive culture conditions) has proceeded despite the lack of information being available on basic nutrient requirements. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that nutritional pathologies resulting from specific nutrient deficiencies or imbalances often occur. This paper will endeavour to highlight the major nutritional pathologies which have been reported in fish fed artificial diets with no access to natural food organisms.

Under practical farming conditions dietary EAA deficiencies may arise from one of four possible routes:
- Poor feed formulation arising from the use of disproportionate amounts of feed proteins with natural specific EAA deficiencies. Table 1 presents the chemical score and limiting EAAs of some selected food proteins available to the fish feed compounder. For the sake of comparison chemical scores have been calculated for individual protein sources with reference to the mean dietary EAA requirements of rainbow trout and common carp (Ogino, 1980). Compared to fish meal, which has a well balanced EAA profile, the majority of protein sources presented have amino acid imbalances which render them unsuitable as a sole source of dietary protein for fish. For example, the deficiency of methionine in plant proteins, yeast, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and hydrolysed feather meal; the deficiency of lysine in oilseeds, hydrolysed feather meal and algae; the deficiency of threonine in some oilseeds and pulses; and the deficiency of tryptophan in fish silage. It is clear that during
feed formulation special care must be given to the choice of feed-stuffs used so that the desired overall dietary EAA profile is obtained.
Dietary imbalances may also arise from the presence of disproportionate levels of specific amino acids; including leucine/isoleucine antagonisms, and to a lesser extent arginine/lysine and cystine/methionine antagonisms. For example, blood meal is a rich source of valine, leucine and histidine, but is a very poor source of methionine and isoleucine. However, in view of the antagonistic effect of excess leucine on isoleucine, animals fed high dietary levels of blood meal suffer from an isoleucine deficiency caused by an excess of dietary leucine (Taylor, Cole and Lewis, 1977). Although similar antagonisms have also been reported for cystine/methionine (use of hydrolysed feather meal; Ichhponani and Lodhi, 1976) and arginine/lysine (Harper, Benevenga and Wohlhueter, 1970) in terrestrial farm animals, they have not been found to occur in fish fed synthetic amino acid diet combinations (Robinson, Wilson and Poe, 1981).
- Dietary EAA deficiencies may arise from excessive heat treatment of feed proteins during feed/diet manufacture. For example, under conditions of excessive heat treatment proteins become more resistant to digestion due to peptide bond formation occurring between the side chains of lysine and dicarboxylic acid. The free epsilon amino groups of lysine are particularly susceptible to heat damage, forming addition compounds with non-protein molecules (reducing sugars) present in the foodstuff (Cockerell, Francis and Halliday, 1972). An estimate of the biological value of the feed protein can be made by chemically measuring the free or available lysine content (epsilon amino group availability; Cowey, 1979).
- Dietary EAA deficiencies may arise from the chemical treatment of feed proteins with acids (silage production) or alkalies, due to the loss of free tryptophan and lysine/cystine respectively (Kies, 1981).
- Dietary EAA deficiencies may arise from the leaching of free and protein bound amino acids into the water. For example, Grabner, Wieser and Lackner (1981), reported the loss, through leaching, of almost all the free and about one-third of the free plus protein bound amino acids from frozen or freeze-dried zooplankton (Artemia salina and Moina spp.) after a 10 min. water immersion period at 9°C.
2.2 Toxic non-essential amino acids
Although not documented, nutritional pathologies may arise from the ingestion of feed proteins containing toxic amino acids. Feed proteins known to contain toxic amino acids include alkali-treated soybean (toxic amino acid - lysinoalanine), the legume Leucaena leucocephala (toxic amino acid - mimosine) and the faba bean Vicia faba (toxic amino acid - dihydroxyphenylalanine).

Dietary EFA deficiencies generally result from poor feed formulation.
3.2 Dietary EFA toxicity
Under laboratory conditions it has been found that a dietary excess of EFA may exert a negative effect on fish growth and feed efficiency (rainbow trout - Yu and Sinnhuber, 1976; Takeuchi and Watanabe, 1979; coho salmon - Yu and Sinnhuber, 1979).
3.3 Toxic non-essential fatty acids
Cyclopropenoic acid is a toxic fatty acid found in the lipid fraction of cottonseed products. Experimentally, cyclopropenoic acid has been shown to reduce growth rate in rainbow trout and to act as a potent synergist for the carcinogenity of aflatoxins (Lee and Sinnhuber, 1972; Hendricks et al. 1980). Other pathologies observed with trout include extreme liver damage (pale^o in colour) with increased glycogen deposition and decreased protein content, and a decrease in activity of several key enzymes (Roehm et al. 1970; Taylor, Montgomery and Lee, 1973).
3.4 Oxidation of dietary lipids
In the absence of suitable antioxidant protection lipids rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, including EFA) are highly prone to auto-oxidation on exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Under these conditions, the nutritional benefit of EFA in fact becomes deleterious to the health of the fish. Feedstuffs rich in PUFA which are particularly susceptible to lipid oxidative damage (oxidative rancidity) include fish oils, fish meal, rice bran and expeller oil seed cakes containing little or no natural antioxidant activity. During the process of lipid auto-oxidation chemical degradation products are formed, including free radicals, peroxides, hydroperoxides, aldehydes and ketones, which in turn react with other dietary ingredients (vitamins, proteins and other lipids) reducing their biological value and availability during digestion. At present oxidative rancidity is believed to be one of the major deteriorative changes which occurs in stored feedstuffs (Cockerell, Francis and
Halliday, 1972; Chow, 1980).
Numerous gross anatomical pathological signs have been reported in fish fed rations containing oxidized fish/plant oils with no antioxidant (vitamin E) protection:

(1966); 5-Hata and Kaneda (1980); 6-Murai and Andrews (1974); 7-Park (1978); 8-Sakaguchi and Hamaguchi (1969); 9-Cowey et al. (1984); 10-Smith (1979); 11-Moccia et al. (1984); 12-Hung, Cho and Slinger (1981)
With the exception of the study of Soliman, Roberts and Jauncey (1983) with Oreochromis niloticus, the pathological effects of oxidized lipids have been shown to be prevented by dietary supplementation with dl-alpha tocopherol acetate (vitamin E). During the six weeks feeding trial of Soliman, Roberts and Jauncey (1983) the dietary supplementation of vitamin E to an oxidized fish oil diet only prevented the occurrence of lordosis. Although no vitamin E analyses were performed on diet or fish tissue at the end of the experiment, in contrast to previous studies with fast growing tropical fish these authors also reported no pathological deficiency signs in fish fed diets containing fresh lipid with no dietary vitamin E supplementation. Clearly, long term studies are required.
In the absence of suitable antioxidant protection the rate of lipid auto-oxidation in stored feedstuffs has been found to increase in the presence of lipoxidase (present in raw soybeans); haeme compounds (myoglobin/haemoglobin are pro-oxidants present in meat/fish meals); peroxides (product of lipid auto-oxidation); light (UV - formation of singlet oxygen/free radicals); increased temperature (reaction rate); and trace elements (Fe and Cu have been found to accelerate lipid oxidation by direct electron transfer in redox reactions, whereas Zn induces the breakdown of hydro-peroxides to free radicals (ADCP, 1983).

Despite the presence of macro and trace elements in virtually all raw ingredients commonly used for fish feeding (Tacon and De Silva, 1983), and the ability of fish to absorb certain trace elements from the surrounding water, mineral deficiencies may arise under intensive culture conditions through:
- The absence of a specific macro or trace mineral premix within the diet (for details of specific mineral premix formulations see NRC, 1983).
- Reduced mineral bioavailability through dietary imbalances. The availability and utilization of dietary trace elements in fish is dependent upon the dietary source and form of the element ingested, the adequacy of stores within the body, interactions with other mineral elements present in the gastro-intestinal tract and within the body tissues (antagonisms), and finally by element interactions with other dietary ingredients or their metabolites (vitamins, fibre and phytic acid). For example. Table 2 shows the relative availabilities or apparent absorption efficiency of various forms or sources of dietary phosphorus for three fish species.

For certain fish species the availability and absorption of phosphorus and other major elements (calcium) from fish meal and meat and bone meal is further complicated by the absence of an acid-secreting stomach, which is essential for normal bone solubilization. For stomachless fish species soluble monobasic inorganic salts or bioavailable organic salts must therefore be provided in the diet. Conversely, within plant proteins a large proportion of phosphorus is present as organically bound phytates. Not only is phytic acid phosphorus believed to be largely biologically unavailable, but phytic acid also hay the capacity to chelate other trace elements (iron, copper, zinc, cobalt, molybdenum) and by so doing may render them biologically unavailable to the fish during digestion (Spinelli, 1980).
Under practical farming conditions mineral deficiency signs often arise from a dietary imbalance of calcium; due to the antagonistic effect of excess dietary calcium on the absorption of phosphorus (Nakamura, 1982) and the trace elements zinc, iron and manganese (Lall, 1979). For example, the bioavailability of zinc, and to a lesser extent manganese, within white fish meal, has been found to be much lower than that contained in brown fish meal (which has a much lower ash and calcium content; Ketola, 1978, Watanabe, Takeuchi and Ogino, 1980). Thus in experimental feeding trials with rainbow trout, chum salmon and common carp fed on diets in which white fish meal was used without a trace element- supplement, overt trace element deficiency signs arise such as depressed growth, short body dwarfism and cataracts (Watanabe, Takeuchi and Ogino, 1980; Satoh et al. 1983, 1983a; Yamamoto et al. 1983).
4.2 Dietary mineral toxicity
A major hazard which may be associated with the use of unconventional dietary feed ingredients is the presence of heavy metal contaminants including the accumulative elements copper, lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, fluoride, selenium, molybdenum and vanadium. For example, contamination with copper may arise from products fermented within copper lined vessels (brewery by-products), or within pig and poultry excreta from the use of copper based growth stimulants or anti-fungal agents. Other feed ingredients which may contain metal contaminants include: poultry waste - arsenic; paper pulp waste - lead; fish meals -mercury, selenium, arsenic, cadmium and lead; poultry by-product meals - zinc; hydrolysed feather meals - zinc; shellfish - zinc, cadmium; seleniferous accumulating plants of the genera Astragalus and Machaeranthera, or cereals grown in seleniferous soils - selenium; Antartic krill - fluoride.
