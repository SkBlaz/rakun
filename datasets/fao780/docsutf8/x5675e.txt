<title>Inter-Regional project for participatory upland conservation and development (Field Document 5/97) - NEPAL - Results of the 1997 dry season evaluation of 52 water source protection works completed in 1993-1997 in the Bhusunde Khola watershed</title>
<section>1</section>
0. Summary
Water source protection, which includes the capturing of a water source, the construction of a water collection tank or reservoir, and -usually- the laying of PVC water pipes and installation of one or more water taps, has consistently been the most popular activity selected in participatory appraisal and planning exercises at the community level. Water source protection works are jointly implemented by the local population, organized in user groups, and the project. The user groups provide local material, as well as unskilled labour, and the project provides outside materials, as well as skilled labour. About 60 water sources have been treated to date by the project in the Bhusunde Khola watershed in the period of 2050 - 2054 (approximately 1993-1997).
An evaluation was carried out in the dry month of Jesth 2054 (May-June 1997), which covered 52 protected water sources and 76 water points. Results were compared with the results of a similar evaluation, carried out in the dry month of Chaitra 2052 (March-April 1996), which covered 25 protected water sources and 45 water points.
Data are presented on the number and functioning of protected water sources and water points, cleanliness of water tanks and cleaning arrangements, water pipe leakage, presence and functioning of water taps, water point sanitary conditions, and quality and quantity of water flow.
Some older tanks had cracked as a result of mass soil movement. In certain areas, all available water sources seem to have been treated, except for marginal sources. Though there was evidence of wear and tear and deterioration with age, this seemed to be more related to the presence or absence of cleaning arrangements than to the age of the installation.
Several positive trends are observed in cleanliness, care and maintenance, especially when comparing data of the 1996 and 1997 evaluations concerning water source protection works completed in 2050 and 2051. This is explained by the more active role user groups, and especially women groups, are playing in the construction and maintenance of water source protection works.
It is noted that the evaluation could be improved by including questions concerning the user groups, and how they organize and pay for maintenance. It was also recommended to include questions regarding the actual use of the water.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
1.2 Objectives
1.1 Background
The "Inter-regional Project for Participatory Upland Conservation and Development" (GCP/INT/542/ITA) has been operational in the Bhusunde Khola watershed^1 in Gorkha district since September 1992. During many Participatory Rural Appraisal and Planning exercises, water source protection has been the most popular activity to be included in Community Action Plans^2. Water Source Protection includes the capturing of a water source, the construction of a water collection tank or reservoir, and - usually - the laying of PVC water pipes and installation of one or more water taps.
^1 The 3200 ha Bhusunde Khola sub-watershed is located within the Middle Hills of Gorkha District. The altitude ranges from 500-1500 m asl, and topography is steep. Annual rainfall is around 1, 900 mm. The average family landholding is under 1 ha, with under 0.2 ha arable land per person.
^2 Where participatory planning in 1992 was almost random, it became more structured, involving PRAs and ward level plans in 1993, was subsequently scaled down to hamlets or communities in 1995/96, and further down to "real" user groups in 1996/97. This was accompanied by more and more attention to capacity building of user groups to make the whole development process more sustainable.
Water Source Protection works are jointly implemented by the local population, organized in user groups, and the project^3. The user groups provide local material, typically sand and stones, as well as unskilled labour. The project provides outside materials, such as cement, iron rods, pipes, taps, as well as skilled labour. About 60 water sources have been treated to date by the project in the Bhusunde Khola watershed.
^3 Poor peasants are clearly willing to contribute a large share of costs of development activities targeted at the improvement of their own living conditions, especially when fully involved in the planning process. Effective user groups are essential in the participatory development process.
Because of the importance of the activity for the local population and for the project, it seemed imperative to know whether water source protection works implemented with the assistance of the project were actually functioning or not. Therefore, a first round of monitoring an evaluation of water source protection works was carried out in the month of Chaitra 2052 (March-April 1996), in which 25 protected sources and 45 associated tap stands were included. The results of this evaluation have been presented in Field Document 1/97.
It was concluded in the 1996 evaluation that in general water source protection works completed between 2050 and 2052 were functioning acceptably well in the dry month of Chaitra 2052 (March-April 1996). There were signs of wearing and deterioration with age of these installations, especially pipe leakage and malfunctioning of taps increased significantly through the years. It was observed that sanitary conditions of both tap stands and water tanks did not seem to depend much from cleaning arrangements (most were fairly clean). It was also recommended to repeat the evaluation exercise on an annual basis to monitor further developments and trends.
Since the Chaitra 2052 (March-April 1996) evaluation, the number of completed water source protection works has increased substantially. Apart from this physical activity, continuous efforts have also been made by the project to increase the capacity of the user groups in the watershed to become more active and self-reliant. This was done through many training workshops (self-reliance, record-keeping, and so on), and through the regular support through the Group Promoters. As a result, there has been a significant increase in the number of active user groups, especially women groups.
A second water source protection works evaluation exercise was carried out in the dry month of Jesth 2054 (May-June 1997), covering 52 protected water sources and 76 associated water points in the Bhusunde Khola watershed. This report presents the results and conclusions of this evaluation.
1.2 Objectives
The objectives of the Jesth 2054 (May-June 1997) evaluation of water source protection works completed with project assistance between 2050 (1993) and the beginning of 2054 (1997) were to:
1. Establish whether and how the water source protection works were functioning, used and maintained;
2. Assess whether any significant changes had taken place concerning functioning, use and maintenance of protected water sources, as compared to the Chaitra 2052 (March-April 1996) evaluation.

2.1.1 Protected Water Source (evaluation) Form
2.1.2 Field work
2.1.3 Analyses
2.1.1 Protected Water Source (evaluation) Form
A simple Protected Water Source (evaluation) Form had been developed in September 1995 by the international consultant, Mr. P. Warren, in collaboration with the project staff, in particular the national expert, Mr. D.R. Chapa. This form was subsequently translated in Nepali, printed and tested in the month of Chaitra 2052 (March-April 1996) (see Annex A in Field Document 1/97).
It was concluded that some modifications, especially simplifications should be made in this form. However, no new form was designed. Instead the field workers were instructed as to which questions to ignore and which to fill in.
2.1.2 Field work
Water supply systems should be evaluated at the moment in time of highest stress: towards the end of the dry season, or between the months of Chaitra (March-April) and Jesth (May-June). The previous evaluation took place in Chaitra 2052. Field work for this years' evaluation was done in Jesth 2054 (May-June). Jesth is actually a pre-monsoon month, with increased chances of rainfall. However, such rainfall is usually too little to have a positive effect on groundwater levels and related discharge in water sources. This was also the case in 2054.
As during the previous evaluation, the field work was carried out by the five project Group Promoters (all women) based in the Bhusunde Khola watershed. In general they did a good job. Some problems arose in the correct identification of some of the older water source protection works, and some of these were unintentionally omitted.
Work on some other sources was still under way during the evaluation. These were not included.
2.1.3 Analyses
Analyses of the evaluation results started soon after the actual evaluation took place. The first step was translation into english, followed by verification and comparison with last years evaluation data. This revealed a number of inconsistencies that were clarified by the Group Promoters. Subsequently the data of the evaluation forms were entered in a computer spreadsheet program (Quatro Pro), which has also database features. Further analyses consisted mainly of simple direct cross-checking (with a pen and a piece of paper). This combination of computerized and traditional analyses worked quick and efficiently.

2.2.1 Number of protected water sources and related water taps
The first water source protection works supported by the project in the Bhusunde Khola watershed started early in 2050 and were completed in that same year (April 1993 - April 1994). In the PRA and micro-planning exercises that took place in November-December 1993 a substantial number of water sources was prioritized for protection works to be implemented in 1994 (appr. 2051). However, these works were in most cases delayed to 1 995 and even 1996 (appr. 2052 and 2053), because during much of 1 994 project activities were affected by the bridging period between phase 1 and phase 2.
Another Participatory Rural Appraisal and Planning exercise was carried out between October 1995 and January 1996 (2052), and 52 water source protection works were included in the resulting 26 Community Action Plans (see also Field Document 3/97). Of these 52, 18 were screened out in participatory feasibility analyses and other applied criteria, while two were "taken over" by other agencies. Of the remaining 34 planned and feasible water source protection works, 31 were actually implemented during 1996 and the first 6 months of 1997 (2053 and the first 2 months of 2054) (see also Field Document 4/97).
A series of 5 Participatory Evaluation and Re-Planning Workshops were conducted in the period October - December 1996 (2053). During these the implementation of a number of as yet non-accomplished water source protection works was rescheduled, and a number of additional works were also included (see also Field Document 7/96).
In total 52 protected water sources were evaluated in Jesth 2054 (May-June 1997). Of these, 9 (17%) had been completed in 2050, 2 (4%) in 2051, 14 (27%) in 2052, 22 (42%) in 2053, and 5 (10%) in 2054 (see Table 1 and Figure 1). A total of 76 water points were associated with these 52 sources, of which 12 (16%) were completed in 2050, 3 (4%) in 2051, 26 (34%) in 2052, 29 (38%) in 2053, and 5 (7%) in 2054 (see Table 1 and Figure 3).
The number of water taps or water points per protected source varied from one to six (and not seven as had been erroneously reported in the previous evaluation). Out of the 52 protected water sources included in the evaluation, 34 (65%) were equipped with one water tap, 11 (21%) with two taps, 4 (8%) with multiple taps systems, while 3 (6%) had no tap, but only consisted of an improved collection tank (traditional "kuwa") (see Table 1 and Figure 2).
Out of a total of 76 water points, 73 (96%) were water taps, and 3 (4%) were improved traditional "kuwa's" (see Table 1). Out of 73 taps, 34 (47%) belonged to single tap systems, 22 (30%) were part of double tap systems, and 17 (23%) were part of multiple tap systems. In the previous evaluation only 12% of the taps were part of a single tap system.
Though it had previously been concluded that "multi-tap systems ... should be avoided or designed with more care in order to ensure functioning of all attached taps" (see Field Document 1/97), this is not necessarily the reason that more recently constructed water source protection works have fewer water taps. It could very well be, that fewer high discharge water sources are available.
The inclusion of improved traditional "kuwa's", all located in the project's concentration area, also seems to indicate that all water sources that have potential to serve as "normal" water supply system, i.e. with water taps, have already been treated in that particular area (Chhoprak wards #7, 8 and 9).
It should also be noted that 4 out of 9 (44%) water tanks completed in 2050 were reported to be cracked as a result of mass soil movement. Three of these are located in Chhoprak ward #1 and one in Chhoprak ward #3, an area characterized by unstable and very steep slopes. Landuse around these tanks should have been restricted, but at least in one case the author observed paddy cultivation almost up to the collection tank in an extremely erosion prone area.
2.2.2 Cleanliness of water tanks and cleaning arrangements
A large majority of the water collection tanks, 41 out of 52 (79%) was found to be clean. The rest was considered to be dirty (9 cases or 17%), very dirty (1 case or 2%), or not reported (1 case or 2%). Not a single water tank was considered to be very clean (see Table 2 and Figure 4).
There seemed to be a clear deterioration of tank cleanliness status with age of the installation. Only 56% of water tanks completed in 2050 or 2051 was clean, while 64%, 95% and 100% of the tanks completed in 2052, 2053 and 2054 respectively were clean (see Figure 5a-d).
Tank cleaning arrangements existed for 39 (75%) of the tanks. There was a clear increase of tank cleaning arrangements with the completion year. Only 6 (55%) of the tanks completed in 2050 or 2051 hade cleaning arrangements, as well as 9 (64%), 19 (86%) and 5 (100%) of those completed in 2052, 2053 and 2054 respectively (see Table 3 and Figure 6a-d).
Contrary to the 1996 evaluation, there was now a very clear relation between tank cleanliness and cleaning arrangements (see Table 4). Only in 2 cases was the tank clean while there were no cleaning arrangements, both of which had been completed recently, in 2053. Both these water tanks without cleaning arrangements are likely to become dirty in future years.
During the 1996 evaluation, only 9 out of 15 tanks completed in 2052 had cleaning arrangements, but all 1 5 were actually clean. During the 1 997 evaluation, still only 9 of the tanks completed in 2052 had cleaning arrangements, but this time only these 9 tanks were actually clean. The tanks without cleaning arrangement, and which had been clean in 1996, were classified in 1997 as dirty or very dirty.
2.2.3 Water pipe leakage
There was no noticeable water leakage in the pipes of 56 out of 73 reported upon tap stands (77%). There was little leakage in 10 cases (14%) and much leakage in 7 cases (10%) (see Table 5).
Of the tap stands completed in 2050 and 2051, 47% showed no pipe leakage, 33% little leakage and 20% much leakage. Taps stands completed in 2052 and 2053 showed no signs of pipe leakage in 85% and 81% respectively, while those completed in 2054 had no leakage at all (100%) (see Figure 7a-d).
When comparing the 1997 evaluation data of the tap stands completed in 2050 and 2051 with the 1996 evaluation data, it appears that the number of taps with no pipe leakage had - contrary to expectation - actually slightly increased from 43% to 47%. Cases with little pipe leakage had substantially increased from 14% to 33%. Those with much pipe leakage had actually decreased from 40% in 1996 to 20% in 1997. This indicates improvements in care and maintenance in 1997 of these older installations as compared to 1996.
Further analyses shows that of the 9 tap stands completed in 2050 and 2051 attached to water tanks with cleaning arrangements, 7 (78%) had no pipe leakage, and 2 (22%) little pipe leakage, while none (0%) had much pipe leakage. Of the 6 tap stand attached to water tanks without cleaning arrangements, 3 (50%) had much pipe leakage, another 3 (50%) had little pipe leakage, and none (0%) had no pipe leakage.
2.2.4 Presence and functioning of tap stands
Not all water points are actually equipped with a water tap (or faucet). Apart from the occasional improved "kuwa" (traditional collection tank without tap), water taps have some times not yet been installed, or have been removed (most likely because they malfunction). In 58 out of 73 case (79%), water points were equipped with a functioning water tap, while in 10 cases (14%) there was no tap, and in 5 cases (7%) a tap was present but not functioning (see Table 6).
Contrary to expectations the tap stands completed in 2052 had poorest performance, with 8 cases (36%) of no or not functioning taps, while of those completed in 2050 only 1 case (9%) was reported to be missing, while 11 (92%) had functioning taps.
When comparing results of the 1996 and 1997 evaluations, it appears that the absolute numbers of absent or malfunctioning taps had remained stable, while the amount of functioning taps sharply increased from 31 to 58 (see Figure 8a).
When comparing the 1996 and 1997 evaluation results concerning water taps completed in 2050, it appears that the number of functioning taps has sharply increased from 4 (36%) in 1996 to 11 (92%) in 1997 (see Figure 8b). This also indicates improved care and maintenance in 1997 as compared to 1996.
2.2.5 Water point sanitary conditions
Water point sanitary conditions varied from good to bad, with 40 out of 76 (53%) in good condition, while 27 (36%) were reported to be fair and 5 (7%) were reported to be bad, 4 (5%) were not reported upon (see Table 7 and Figure 9a). There appears to be a clear relation between sanitary conditions of the water points and the completion year of their installation. Only 33% of water points completed in 2050 and 2051 were classified as good, while 40% were classified as fair and 27% as bad. Of those completed in 2052, 42% were good, 46% fair, 4% bad and 8% not reported upon. Water points completed in 2053 and 2054 scored 69% and 67% good, 28% and 17% fair, 0% bad, and 3% and 17% not reported (see Figure 10a-d).
During the 1996 evaluation, the majority of the water points, 82%, had fair sanitary conditions, and only 13% were good, while 4% were bad. There has been a remarkable increase in sanitary conditions of the water points between the 1996 and 1997 evaluations (see Figure 9a). This does not only concern the newly completed water points, but also and in particular the older installations. Comparison of the 2053 and 2054 evaluation data of water points completed in 2050, showed a remarkable increase from 0 (0%) to 5 (42%) of good cases, and related sharp decreases in fair cases from 10 (91%) to 3 (25%) cases, while bad cases increased from 1 (9%) to 4 (36%). These data confirm earlier indications of improved care and maintenance of the protected water sources and water supply systems.
2.2.6 Quality of water flow
The quality of water flow from the taps and "kuwas" was only evaluated using clarity as criteria. The vast majority, 67 (88%) were providing clear water, while 4 (5%) had dirty water, 5 (7%) was not reported or had no water at the time of evaluation, and none (0%) had very clear water^4 (see Table 8 and Figure 11). The oldest installations had a greater likelihood of dirty or no water: those completed in 2050 provided only in 8 cases (67%) clear water.
^4 It should be noted, that there was no definition of "very clear".
When comparing these data with the 1996 evaluation, it appears that there was some deterioration in water quality, in 1996 all water points (100%) had clear water. There could be two reasons for this, the fact that the 1997 evaluation took place later in the dry season (less water flow), and some deterioration in the installations themselves (some of the older water tanks show cracks and other damage due to land slips).
2.2.7 Quantity of water flow
Water flow or discharge was measured at the water taps, in seconds to fill a 1 liter bottle. Measured water flow varied from "1" second to fill a 1 liter bottle, to "300" seconds (i.e. 5 minutes), while a number of taps had no water at all, or were not reported upon. These reported data were grouped in intervals of 1-10 seconds, 11-20 seconds, 21-30 seconds, 31-60 seconds, and more than 1 minute.
The highest fraction of water taps, 29% (21 cases) fell within the 1-10 seconds interval, with a further 19% (14 cases) in the 11-20 seconds interval, and 10% (7 cases) in the 21-30 seconds interval. Thus 57% of the taps (42 cases) fell within the relatively good category of 1 -30 seconds to fill a 1 liter bottle. A total of 22% (16 cases) fell within the 31-60 seconds category, and 11% (8 cases) in the more than 1 minute category. The rest, 10% (7 cases), had no water or was for some other reason not reported upon (see Table 9 and Figure 12).
Compared to the 1996 evaluation data, there was a clear reduction in water flow. Of the water taps completed between 2050 and 2052, 35 were in the 0-30 seconds interval in Chaitra 2052 (March-April 1996), but only 20 were in this interval in Jesth 2054 (May-June 1997). It is assumed that this difference is largely due to the fact that the 1997 evaluation was carried out later in the dry season, and to a lesser extent to damage that has occurred to the some of the older water collection tanks.
There also seems to be a relation between water flow and location of the protected water source: 50% of the water taps which need more than 30 seconds and more than 1 minute to fill a 1 liter bottle, are located on the North facing slopes of the watershed, in Khoplang VDC.
2.3 Conclusions
2.3.1 Protected water sources state and functioning
2.3.2 Changes in 1997 as compared to the 1996 evaluation
2.3.3 Protected water source evaluation
2.3.1 Protected water sources state and functioning
In general, the water source protection and water supply works completed by the project in the Bhusunde Khola watershed between 2050 and 2054 were functioning acceptably well in the dry month of Jesth 2054 (May-June 1997). However, in a significant number of cases water flow was extremely low (11%), or altogether absent (10%). This is partly due to the fact that the evaluation took place during the period of greatest stress (last month of the dry season), and partly due to damage occurring in some of the older water collection tanks, apparently as a result of mass soil movements. These damaged installations are located on very steep and instable South facing slopes, while landuse around the tank had not been adequately restricted and no particular conservation measures had been applied.
Water sources on the North facing slopes of the watershed (i.e. Khoplang VDC) have a larger than average likelihood to have very low discharge flows during the dry season.
The inclusion of improved traditional water collection sites, without water taps ("kuwa's"), and the fact that recently constructed water source protection works have fewer water taps, indicates that fewer high discharge water sources with potential to serve as "normal" water supply systems, are available, in particular in the project concentration area (Chhoprak wards #7, 8 and 9).
There were also other signs of wearing and deterioration with age of the water source protection works, including pipe leakage, malfunctioning of taps (faucets), cleanliness of water tanks and sanitary conditions of water points. However, this seemed more related to the presence or absence of cleaning arrangements than of the age of the installation.
By comparing the results of the 1996 and 1997 evaluation data, it appears that water tanks without formal cleaning arrangements will remain "clean" for about 1 year, while taps stand sanitary conditions deteriorate much faster.
2.3.2 Changes in 1997 as compared to the 1996 evaluation
Several positive trends can be observed when comparing the results of the 1996 and 1997 evaluation data, especially when comparing tanks constructed in 2050, 2051, and to a lesser extent 2052. The percentage of protected water sources with tank cleaning arrangements significantly increased, and so did the cleanliness of the tanks. Pipe leakage of older installations decreased, and presence and functioning of water taps, as well as water point sanitary conditions sharply increased. However, in some installations the situation deteriorated, in particular in those that remained without cleaning arrangements.
The Group Promoters, who had filled out the evaluation forms, were questioned about these data, in particular they were asked whether they had more easily used terms like good and clean in 1997 than in 1996. They unanimously replied that this was not the case, and that there was a genuine improvement of the sanitary conditions, presence and functioning of water taps, and so on, because the concerned user groups were stronger and more active than before.
The water source protection works that were completed in 2050 and 2051 were constructed during the first phase of the project, when less stringent criteria were used for user groups to qualify for project assistance. Hence, these protected water sources completed in 2050 and 2051 never had a strong user group to ensure their maintenance. However, during the second phase of the project, user group capacity building was much more emphasized, and consequently a number of new groups has started to take care of the protected water sources completed in 2050 and 2051. This explains the large difference and general improvement in water tank cleanliness, pipe leakage, functioning and cleanliness of water points completed in 2050 and 2051 between the 1996 and 1997 evaluations.
In this respect, it is important to note that in particular woman groups have been created and activated during the past two years. Whereas in the first years of the project all agreements for water source protection works were made with male dominated user groups, now more than two thirds of such agreements are signed by women groups.
Those installations that did not benefit from a new a strengthened user group further deteriorated during this period (see also Figures 8b and 9b).
These data would seem to provide evidence for the hypothesis that the participatory development approach, in which strong and self-reliant user groups play a pivotal role, results in greater sustainability of small scale infrastructure works.
2.3.3 Protected water source evaluation
The protected water source evaluation provided valuable data on the quality of this activity, though little technical information. It was found that the field work of the evaluation does not take much time, one evaluator can cover several protected water sources and related taps in one day. The quality of the data gathered was positively influenced by the fact that the field workers, the Group Promoters, had carried out a similar evaluation in the same area in 1996.
Similarly, the analyses and report writing of the evaluation also did not take too much time, mainly because the number of question in the questionnaire had been very limited. Comparison of the 1997 evaluation data with the 1996 evaluation data provided much deeper insight in the processes taking part in the project area, and which do not only reflect on the water source protection activity itself.
Thus, the limitations of the evaluation also became clear. Where it was found that much improvement was due to better care taking of stronger and more self-reliant user groups, it was an omission not to have included the names of these user groups in the questionnaire. Similarly, where obviously faucets had been replaced and maintenance and repairs made, no questions were asked as to how this had been organized, and who had paid for this.
It was also noted that the evaluation provided no indications regarding the use of that was made of the water: for human consumption, for livestock and stall-feeding, for vegetable production, etc. Such data would have been valuable to make an attempt at an economic evaluation of water source protection.
If, however, such additional questions would have been asked, time required for field work and analyses would have very significantly increased, and reporting time would have been much longer.

3. Recommendations
3.1. Water source protection
3.2 User group capacity
3.3 Evaluation methods
3.1. Water source protection
Water source protection and related water supply systems are a major activity of great importance to rural mountain communities. Time and again it was the most popular activity coming out of participatory planning exercises. It is also an entry point activity when starting a rural development program in mountainous areas. To function properly and on a sustainable bases, strong and self-reliant user groups are needed to take care of and maintain the installations.
The most obvious water sources, with high and permanent water discharge levels tend to be treated first. In due course, more marginal sources are identified by the local population for treatment. Clear criteria have so far not been defined for water source protection works. Some of the potential criteria, such as quantity of water discharge in the dry season, may be difficult to assess during a (participatory) feasibility study, unless this feasibility study also takes place in the dry season.
3.2 User group capacity
The clear improvements between 1996 and 1997 in care and maintenance of the protected water sources was linked to the strengthening of local user groups during this period. It should be noted, that it were in particular women groups that actually gained in numbers and strength, while some of the male dominated groups have quietly passed away. The fact that nowadays most agreements for water source protection works are made with women groups is largely due to the stringent criteria set by the project for groups to get assistance (regular savings, regular meetings and record keeping, as well as self-initiated activities).
It is recommended to continue to apply such stringent criteria to user groups, in particular in water source protection works, and to encourage women groups to take up responsibility for construction and maintenance for such works through signed agreements. Field staff, in particular (usually male) mid-level technicians dealing with water source protection, should be aware of the important role that self-reliant user groups, and in particular women groups, play in the care and maintenance of these installations, and handle accordingly.
3.3 Evaluation methods
The evaluation was short, simple, easy to handle, and quickly executed and analyzed. The results were very interesting, in particular also because a comparison could be made with a previous evaluation. There has been a clear added value of the repeated evaluation on an annual basis. It is recommended to continue to repeat the evaluation exercise on an annual basis.
However, a number of questions were raised that remained unanswered, such as:
(i) What are the actual user groups involved in care and maintenance of the (older) protected water sources;
(ii) How do user groups actually organize maintenance; and
