Framework for farm household-level decision making
Framework for farm household-level decision making
The Farm Household
The farm household is the level at which most resource allocation decisions are made. Division of roles and responsibilities among different family members occurs naturally among men, women, productive youth, and the elderly. Based on their respective duties, Farm Management Decisions are made (Part I). These may be broken down into: investment and marketing decisions; and production and conservation decisions. See Fig. 1.
Fig. 1: Framework for Analysing Farm Household Decidisions
These decisions are influenced by On-Farm Factors (Part 11), and Off-Farm Factors (Part 111). It should be pointed out that people do not use a linear decision making process. Rather, farmers consider many factors simultaneously. The framework is a tool to help understand these complex farm management decisions so that appropriate extension and development strategies can be developed.

Part I: Farm Management Decisions
Investment and marketing decisions
Box 1 summarizes some of the key resource allocation decisions faced by farm families. For example, if a need or market opportunity is identified for fuelwood, the family will have to choose what specific tree to plant, who will be responsible for its establishment and maintenance, what land will be used, what investment (labour, money and materials) will be required, and how the products will be marketed.
Production and conservation decisions
Given the above investment and market decisions, farmers must also make choices regarding management of the production process. The best farmers will also try to identify means by which production can be sustained from year to year by minimizing damage to their resource base. Box 7 summarizes the sorts of choices they must make.

Decisions related to the management of perennial crops for fuelwood, may be related to stabilization of terraces, provision of dry-season fodder for livestock, and spatial arrangement of fuelwood trees so that they do not interfere too much with food crop production.
Conservation practices such as contour planting, vegetative erosion control and construction of drop structures all require additional labour and investment. Such investment must be weighed in relation to other income generating opportunities such as off-farm employment or home-based industries that ensure guaranteed sources of revenue. For example, processing of charcoal is an off-season enterprise that may attract farmers' attention away from longer-term conservation activities.

Part II: On-farm Factors
On-farm conditions affecting decision making are broadly divided into socioeconomic and biophysical factors. See Fig. 2.
Fig. 2: On-farm Conditions Affecting Household Decision-making.
Socioeconomic
A central factor affecting investment, production, and conservation decisions is the farmer's level of control over his land (see Box 3). A farmer with secure tenure is much more likely to think of long-term production and conservation activities than are sharecroppers or migrant laborers. The amount and types of land under stewardship of the farm household is critical.
Household composition and allocation of responsibilities to different family members is also important in making farm management decisions. Division of family chores by gender partially determines how resource allocation decisions are made. It should be emphasized that "gender" refers to age and status as well as sex. For example, studies have shown that women tend to prefer the planting of trees for fuelwood, fodder and fruit while men are said to prefer the production of timber that can be sold commercially. This has much to do with women's role in fodder and fuelwood collection; a role that can take them far away from the farm and require heavy labour. Likewise, children often play an important role in caring for livestock.
Subsistence farmers typically have different aspirations from market-oriented or commercial farmers. These ambitions are reflected in their beliefs, attitudes, and investment patterns Different farmers also have varying risk tolerance levels based on savings and basic food security. Subsistence farmers tend to have less tolerance for risk because they are closer to the borderline in terms of savings and liquid assets. Off-farm employment is attractive because it is associated with low risk. Also, farmers with heavy debts and obligations cannot afford to risk their family welfare with untested technologies.

Biophysical
Biophysical factors are, for the most part, beyond the control of the farm family. These factors, as described in Box 4, have a direct influence on selection of a crop. There is, however, usually considerable variation in the microclimate of different parts of the farm. For example, the home garden is usually located near or around the household residence. It tends to get closer attention from women, receives more regular watering and fertilizing, and is more closely associated with subsistence than commercial objectives. Water, however, is nearly always the prime limiting factor. Soil, slope, temperature distribution and altitude are also influential for perennial crops. Finally, trees and some annual crops are sensitive to sun and wind exposure as well as biological factors. There are a number of tools available for matching species with biophysical factors but, as discussed earlier, the socioeconomic factors must be considered at the same time. Farmers do this intuitively
and they almost always have good reasons for their decisions.
Part III: Off-Farm Factors
Off-farm factors have an influence on farm household decision making as represented in figure 3:
Markets and market channels
Farm families need outside information for making investment and marketing decisions. Even though not all farmers do detailed cost-benefit analyses, they usually make a budget "in their heads". Often they also make rough budgets on paper before making a decision. Box 5 presents some of the market options that the farmer has.
Fig. 3: Off-farm Factors Affecting Household Decisions
Farmers seek market information from middlemen, producers associations, retailers, wholesalers, processors, manufacturers and other farmers. A competitive market is, unfortunately, not always present. Having said this, there is usually great opportunity to tap into domestic and international markets.
Small farmers who are not organized into groups will find it difficult to achieve the scale of production that is demanded by more up-scale markets. Group organization under these conditions, therefore, becomes a key element.

Policies, Rules and Regulations
Household decisions are also affected by policies, rules, and regulations that are enforced by the state and community. Examples are given in Box 6. These may be enforced either at the local or the national level. For example, teak in most countries requires a permit to be felled and transported. This is a constraint for farmers who are exploited by unscrupulous officials. These laws are, however, necessary to protect public forest resources.
Apart from formal legislation and policies, there are traditional customs and practices that govern management of agricultural lands. User rights are particularly important for farmers who live on the fringes of state forests and have a ready supply of fuelwood.

Support Services
External support services are often needed to take advantage of market and production opportunities. Lack of roads for transport of farm produce to the market is a clear constraint in some locations.
Other factors such as those highlighted in Box 7, however, are also important. Depending on the extension strategy and readiness of the farm household to respond to market forces, different support services will play varying roles.

· Credit institutions

· Subsidies

· Market information services Extension services
Technical Information
Issues covered under this heading include information on different aspects of growing crops such as propagation techniques, nutrient requirements and harvesting technologies. Information can be provided from sources such as successful farmers, researchers, extension workers and private industry (see Box 8). An example of how technical information can influence a farmer's decision is mango planting. On poor soil with a pronounced dry season, mango seedlings die if appropriate technologies are not used for establishment. In Central Java farmers dig a hole of 1 x 1 x 1 meter, remove the poor soil and replace it with fertile red soil and organic manure. The next year, farmers dig 4 to 6 one-meter deep drills around the tree and add more organic manure. The purpose for this is to prevent mango roots from growing upwards seeking surface moisture and nutrients. Roots that are enriched with manure grow downwards seeking nutrients at deeper soil levels.

To summarise
The interaction between all the of factors discussed above is presented in figure 4. This may also be used as a framework for the selection of extension strategies which is discussed below.

Extension and development strategies
Extension and development strategies
The purpose of this section is to take a quick look at extension as it has evolved over the past several years. In light of the previous discussion on the farm household, emphasis is given to matching extension strategies with the decision making needs of the farm family. It is apparent that in many development programmes, traditional extension is not stimulating development to a significant extent and this is serious because extension services are expensive. Traditional government extension services are only suitable for a given period of development or under specific sets of conditions. This tends to be in the relatively early stages where government induced programmes are needed to meet national objectives such as food security or import substitution. Once a reasonable proportion of the rural community has moved from subsistence agriculture to a market-driven economy, then governments can gradually invest less in traditional extension and the private sector plays a
greater role.
Fig. 4: Interaction Between All Factors Influencing Household Decisions
Under these conditions, governments can encourage industrial investment in rural areas and act as a stimulator to commercial organizations and farmer groups. There may also be a need to act as a watch-dog for the rights of small farmers to prevent undue exploitation by the powerful few.
Alternative extension approaches
The figure below represents a range of alternative extension approaches. Any one of these may be appropriate at certain points in time and under certain conditions. It is a mistake to try to force any one extension system upon diverse sets of conditions. Governments should encourage voluntary, commercial and farmer organizations to deliver needed services when these mechanisms have a comparative advantage in responding to the evolving needs of farmers. Depending on the status of the farm household and the environment, extension approaches may fall along the continuum illustrated in figure 5.
Fig. 5: Range of Extension Approaches
A detailed discussion of these broad approaches will not be attempted here. Rather, reference may be made to Table 1. This rough typology attempts to link on-farm decision making to alternative extension delivery strategies based on their relative strengths and weaknesses. Although it is tempting to advocate one strategy over another, all of these strategies have proven to be successful at different points in time and under different conditions. For example, if the "green revolution" had waited for development of farmer organizations, an opportunity would have been lost for rapid transfer of technology through coordinated government efforts.

Conclusion
Conclusion
In Southeast Asia investment in agroforestry has progressed extremely fast. To keep up with the industrial sector, farmers are becoming increasingly linked with the mainstream economy. This is an inevitable trend if farmers are to obtain a more equitable share of the benefits of rapid economic growth. Farmers must not remain on the sidelines because there is already a widening gap between urban and rural people. Fuelwood is one component in the production system of farm households. It will play an economic role that is directly commensurate with the value that it brings to the farm household. Extension efforts must, therefore, examine the value of this commodity in the light of competing enterprises. The old top-down technology-driven extension model will not work any longer. Let us all look at the farm family as we look at our own families and learn from their experience as we move forward together.

Introduction
Introduction
A framework for the analysis of farm-level decision making is proposed where the farm household is used as the primary unit of analysis. Each household has a unique set of socioeconomic and biophysical conditions. Agroforestry technology and investment decisions are evaluated by farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs based on key external factors including:
· access to markets;
· access to support services;
· access to scientific and indigenous knowledge; and
· policies, rules and regulations.
The second half of the paper suggests alternative extension strategies based upon an understanding of the farm household. Emphasis is given to tailoring extension approaches to help move farmers from a subsistence orientation to a more entrepreneurial orientation where appropriate.
