Role of women in agriculture
Role of women in agriculture
The percentage of women living in rural areas decreased from 40.3% in 1972 to 29.2% in 1993. Overall, women comprise 17.3% of heads of households in Peru. Of the economically active women, 21.1% worked in the agricultural sector in 1981. More recent data is not available. A large portion of rural women perform unpaid work in agriculture, especially in providing for household needs. Women's roles differ according to geographic zones. Along the coast, women work as agricultural labourers in the cultivation of export crops as well as in food production for the household. In the mountain areas, where women participate in the peasant traditional economy, there is an increasing number of women heads of households due to male migration for work or to armed violence. In the Amazon forest area, the setters practice monoculture of rice and maize, while the river dwellers and indigenous peoples practice both subsistence and cash cropping. Women receive lower pay than men for the same
or equivalent work.
Division of Labour by Gender. The gender division of labour also differs according to zone. On the coast, men are responsible for ploughing, pesticides and irrigation, while women are particularly active in harvesting. In the Amazon forest zone, indigenous and river dwelling women participate in various phases of subsistence farming, while settler women work in household food production, except with meat and fish, and participate in the harvesting and processing of cash crops. In the mountain zone, women participate in all the agricultural tasks, especially land preparation, sowing, banking, weeding, harvesting and irrigation, and are responsible for livestock and small-scale marketing. Everywhere, women are responsible for all household tasks. In the fishery sector, women are mainly involved in food processing and marketing. Because women have the major responsibility for post-harvest activities such as processing and storage, they play a key role in household food
security.
Women also play a key role in livestock, especially in regard to shepherding, feeding, milking, calving and dressing, while men typically tend to the shearing, disinfection, and vaccination.
Gender Relations in Decision-making in Farming Activities. Rural women play a fundamental role in decisions regarding the household, including decisions regarding production, use of resources, and expenditures. However, women's decision-making role tends to be marginalized outside the household, especially in public decision-making bodies.

Sharing of power and decision-making

Members and Officers of Agricultural/Rural Organizations. In areas affected by political violence, women's participation in rural organizations has increased due to male migration, death and disappearance. However, women's decision-making roles are limited mainly to positions such as "secretary for women's affairs". Mothers Clubs are the most widespread women's organizations. Although women participated actively in the peasant struggles led by the Confederation of Peasants of Peru (CCP), they are seldom recognized as farmers in their own right. Although data is not available on the development of women's peasant associations in the CCP, the First National Assembly of Women Peasants was held in 1987 and these groups have been increasing. In the National Agrarian Confederation (CNA), women are playing increasingly significant roles, although they are still a minority of members and decision-makers. A Women's Secretariat was created in the CNA in 1988. The number of independent
peasant women's organizations increased in the 1990s.
Women in Decision-making Positions in Ministries and Government Bodies. The persons working in government bodies dealing with agriculture decreased from about 19,500 in 1990 to 4,149 in 1994. In this sector, women comprise 14.5% of the officials, 27.7% of the professional staff and 40.2% of the technical staff.

Mechanisms to promote the advancement of women
Mechanisms to promote the advancement of women
National Machinery. The Permanent Commission of the Rights of Women and Children of the Ministry of Justice is the office in charge of promoting the rights of women.
WID Units or Focal Points in Technical Ministries. The Ministry of Agriculture coordinates a Technical Cooperation Network of Support Institutions and Bodies for Rural Women which includes public, private and technical bodies. Its activities include gender sensitization of the public sector, collection of information and building of a data bank, support to women farmers organizations, and formulation and financial management of small projects. It is also a forum for the exchange of information and experiences.
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). NGOs have played an important role in Peru since the 1970s. In 1993 there were 895 NGOs registered in the country, 110 of which work directly with women. However, the number of NGOs working in rural areas has decreased from 116 in 1988 to 76 in 1991.
The majority of NGOs working in rural areas aim at organizing rural women and promoting their rights. A number of NGOs work in areas of rural development, such as promoting the efficient use of resources, production, agro-forestry, and technology transfer.

Peru ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1982. Although the Agrarian Reform Law does not explicitly exclude women, in practice land is awarded to the "head of the family" who is traditionally considered to be a man. Women obtain land only as widows, daughters, and indirectly as wives. This situation also applies in the case of the Native Communities Law for Agricultural Development.

Dimensions and determinants of rural poverty
Dimensions and determinants of rural poverty
The economic crisis of the past 10 years has resulted in low investment and consequent low productivity in the agricultural sector. This has been exacerbated by environmental degradation, including desertification as a result of inappropriate agricultural practices, natural disasters and armed violence by terrorist groups, which have caused displacement of a large numbers of families and disrupted agricultural production. Drug trafficking and the production of coca have also disrupted agriculture. Due to the persistent falling prices of agricultural produce, production has also fallen. Rural women have had to compensate by substituting industrial products by homemade ones or by reducing household expenses (often education of girls). Women have also had to assume greater responsibility for subsistence food production and, as producers for the market, have encountered severe restrictions in demand and decreased access to agricultural resources, land, water, credit and
technology. Structural adjustment programmes have had a negative effect on the rural poor, especially women, due to reduced spending on services.

Access to agricultural resources and services
Access to agricultural resources and services
Land. Access to land is limited for both men and women, but especially so for women. Although data is limited, women traditionally have very little access to land in their own right. This situation also prevails in the agrarian reform sector which grants land to the "head of household", considered to be a man. Thus, usually only widows and daughters have direct access to land, while married women have indirect access through their husbands. When women do have land title, the size of their land is generally small.
Forestry. Although women play an active role in forestry activities at the household level, very few participate in communal nurseries or in the Forestry Committees, who are encharged with directing forestry activities. Moreover, according to data collected by the monitoring and evaluation system on women's participation in forestry training in 1994, approximately 30% of the participants were women.
Water. In general, women face several constraints in their access to irrigation, including: lack of decision-making ability within water user's groups; lack of access to training on technical matters and information; prohibitive time schedule of water provision, as access is usually open at night; and discriminatory attitudes which perceive women as "part-time" workers.
Credit. Women's access to credit is extremely limited. Data is scarce, but in general, women comprise no more than 15% of the beneficiaries of credit directed to small farmers. Until it was dissolved, the Agrarian Bank was the main provider of credit. In 1992, a law was passed to facilitate Rural Savings and Credit Associations. NGOs have also promoted revolving funds.
Extension and agricultural training. Training is directed mainly to those areas which are the responsibility of men, although some attention is now being directed to meeting the needs of women for labour-saving technology for both household and agricultural production tasks. Women have very little access to extension. Data on extensionists is limited and not gender-disaggregated, but an FAO survey in 1989 found that about 17% of extensionists were women. A larger number of women are graduates of university-level agricultural education (29.7% in 1990),

· Another project was directed to developing gender sensitization tools, training, courses, and workshops for institutions and organizations working with the rural population.
· Gender is being included as a variable in the design of the second National Agricultural-Livestock Census.
Legal and Policy Reform.
In January of 1995 the Ministry of Agriculture organized a workshop with the Unidad de la Mujer Rural in order to identify the necessary steps to be taken to improve the quality of life in rural areas, and specifically on the means to promote the necessary conditions for women's equal access to and control over productive resources and increased participation in defining strategies.
Access to Agricultural Resources and Services.
A number of government, bi-lateral, multi-lateral and NGO projects have addressed the needs of rural women directly or indirectly in areas such as alternative technologies and the organization of women for food processing activities, credit, community forestry, irrigation and extension.

Areas to be strengthened
Areas to be strengthened
Policy Planning and Research.
· Statistical information on the specific social and economic characteristics of rural women in their various situations is needed in order to develop strategic goals and objectives, and to design projects to benefit rural women. The gender variable should be included in macro-social and sectoral surveys and censuses and all information collection by agricultural bodies. The data collected should be processed and made available for use in planning and decision-making.
· Research should be carried out on: women's contribution to the national economy; the role of indigenous women in the management of natural resources and the environment; the effects of structural adjustment on women; the various aspects of food processing and marketing; the gender division of labour in productive and reproductive tasks; technology to improve women's productivity and incomes and alleviate work burdens; and the effects of the crisis, violence and drug trafficking on women's work.
· Gender sensitization and training should be carried out among decision- and policy-makers in economics, agriculture and the social fields.
Access to Agricultural Resources and Services.
· Appropriate technologies for women's agricultural production and household tasks should be generated, improved and made available, and the transfer of technology should be included in agricultural curricula.
· Women's access to land, water, credit and marketing should be improved through facilitating women's participation in users groups, and through the promotion of revolving funds, women's credit groups and women's participation in rural credit funds and programmes.
· There is also a need to establish the appropriate mechanisms to implement prevailing legislation in regards to land rights and to ensure equal access to land titles for both women and men, and particularly for female-headed households. Training should be provided to a wide range of women and women's groups, including training in financial management, marketing, and in project formulation.
· Increased financial resources should be directed to rural women.

Importance of agriculture to the economy
Importance of agriculture to the economy
Agriculture is important to the economy, although it accounted for only 13.2% of the GDP in 1992, representing a steady decline over the years. About 33% of the labour force is employed in agriculture. The principal cash crop is coffee, which accounted for 2% of export earnings in 1992. Fishing is also significant, with fishmeal accounting for 12.6% of export earnings in 1992. The main food crops are rice, maize and potatoes. Peru is dependent on imports of cereals and food aid to meets its basic food needs. The country has adopted economic stabilization and structural adjustment programmes to control hyperinflation, realign prices and reduce the fiscal deficit. Recent government measures for the agricultural sector include: elimination of controls on food prices, inputs and interest rates; legal, institutional and market reforms, including the elimination of state agricultural marketing enterprises and the Agrarian Bank; and the liberalization of the land market.
