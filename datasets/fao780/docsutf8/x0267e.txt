1. Part I: On-farm factors
The farm household, a decision making unit, is broadly determined by the following on-farm conditions.
· Social and-economic conditions:
- Social setting
- Cultural setting
- Traditional practices
- Economic capacity
· Biophysical conditions
Social and economic conditions
These conditions have a major influence on decision making. Box 1 summarizes social and economic factors that influence decision making.
The social setting
Household composition and allocation of responsibilities to different family members plays an important role in farm management. Division of family chores by gender influences how resource allocation decisions are made. It should be emphasized that "gender" refers to age as well as sex. For example, studies have shown in some countries that women tend to prefer the planting of trees for fuelwood, fodder and fruit while men are said to prefer the production of timber that can be sold commercially. This has much to do with women's role in fodder and fuelwood collection_____ a role that can take them far away from the farm and require heavy labour. Also children are often involved in fuelwood gathering. These children and the elderly often play an important role in caring for livestock, or have other functions in the vicinity of the homestead
Cultural setting
The farm household is guided by the norms and values of its members Gender roles are determined by tradition. Division of roles and responsibilities among family members occurs naturally among men, women, productive youth, and the elderly.
Traditional food habits influence the introduction of crops with a potentially high revenue given local conditions. A example of this is the introduction of potatoes in Europe. Although the rural population suffered malnutrition and starvation, it was only two hundred years after their introduction that potatoes were produced on a massive scale.
Seemingly unproductive crops can have special functions, which make them indispensable for the household. Also, traditional cooking habits can influence fuelwood production. In northern India people sill use cow dung as fuel, although the supply of fuelwood has grown significantly. Due to the specific burning properties of these dung cakes, it is preferred over fuelwood in some areas.

Traditional practices
Traditional production and management practices play a very important role in the farm household. When the farming system is sustainable this factor is no problem. It can, however, become a problem if, due to external factors, the continuation of the traditional system causes serious ecological degradation. These external factors can put pressure on natural resources due to growing population, climatical changes or transmigration. A very common case is degradation of near-by fuelwood resources. Due to over-exploitation or overgrazing, collection of fuelwood can become a difficult and time consuming activity, which usually has a negative effect on family welfare. Fuelwood collection will also detract from other productive duties, such as maintenance of the home garden.
If a farmer is required to change his farming system, it will be difficult, since, from his point of view, his traditional system has proven to be successful for generations. Farmers can be conservative in changing their cropping system, even though they fear for the sustainability of their present system. Economic factors play an important role in adopting new farming systems, since due to the decreasing revenues of his present system, risk tolerance is lowered.
Each farming system has its unique advantages, resulting in a special lifestyle of the farm family. They have adopted special skills in maintaining the system. Indigenous knowledge of this particular system can be very high. However, this indigenous knowledge can have its shortcomings when the system needs adjustment. Also a change of production system can result in a different lifestyle, which can dramatically affect the family. Shifting cultivators, and nomadic livestock farmers will have a natural resistance to becoming sedentary farmers. Also transmigrated farmers tend to pick up their old farming practices in new and different environments.
Economic conditions
A central factor affecting investment, production, and conservation decisions is the farmer's level of control over his land. A farmer with secure tenure is much more likely to think of long-term production and conservation activities than are sharecroppers or migrant laborers. The amount and types of land under stewardship of the farm household is critical. This determines their access to loans, the need for mechanization, the need to do off farm labor and the motivation to produce long-rotation products, such as trees. It also influences the extent of market oriented production.
Subsistence farmers typically have different aspirations from market-oriented or commercial farmers. These ambitions are reflected in their beliefs, attitudes, and labor investment patterns. Farmers also have varying risk tolerance based on their financial situation and food security. Subsistence farmers tend to have less tolerance for risk because they are closer to the borderline in terms of savings and liquid assets. Off-farm employment is attractive because of low risk. Also farmers with heavy debts and obligations cannot afford to risk their family welfare with untested technologies.
Biophysical conditions
Biophysical factors are, for the most part, beyond the direct control of the farm family. These factors, as described in Box 2, have a major influence on selection of crops.
Given the biophysical environment, farmers can influence the condition of their land by irrigation, fertilization, mitigation of extreme climatical conditions with shelterbelts or terracing of steep slopes. It should be emphasized that, when one limiting factor is removed, other factors become limiting factors for optimal production. Since all interventions consume money and/or labour, socioeconomic conditions can also become limiting for optimal production.
Within one farm, there can be considerable variation in the microclimate. Areas located near or around the household residence tend to get closer attention from women and receive more regular watering and fertilizing. These areas are more closely associated with family nutrition and service roles such as shade, rather than commercial objectives. The larger the distance between the homestead and the field, the less attention it will get. These areas tend to get used for low labour intensive production such as livestock grazing, cassava cultivation, timber and fuelwood production.
Based on the interaction between biophysical, social and economic factors, the farm household makes decisions. This brings us to the process of farm management.

Investment and marketing decisions
Box 3 summarizes some of the key resource allocation decisions faced by farm families. Based on market information, the household decides which land and what labour is to be allocated to a certain commodity. The quality and price of seed can be considered, input of pesticides and fertilizer will be evaluated and, if the product is meant primarily for the market, to whom it will be sold. Even contract farming involves such management decisions.

For example, if a need or market opportunity is identified for fuelwood, the family will have to choose what specific tree to plant, how and where to procure seed or seedlings, who will be responsible for its establishment and maintenance, what land will be used, what investment (labour, and materials) will be required, and how the products will be used or sold.

Production and conservation decisions
Given the above investment and market decisions, farmers must also make choices regarding management of the production process. A farmer realizing that the sustainability of his production system is endangered, will also try to identify means by which production can be sustained from year to year by minimizing damage to his resource base. Box 4 summarizes the sorts of choices he must make.
Decisions related to management of perennial crops for fuelwood may be related to stabilization of slopes and terraces, provision of dry-season fodder for livestock, and spatial arrangement of fuelwood trees so that they do not interfere too much with food crop production.

Production and management of agricultural enterprises
· Perennial crops
· Annual crops
· Livestock/fish
· Post-harvest processing
Conservation practices
· Crop management practices
· Erosion control practices
Conservation practices such as contour planning, vegetative erosion control, wind breaks and gully control all require additional labor and investment. Such investment must be weighed in relation to other income generating opportunities such as off farm employment or home-based industries that ensure guaranteed sources of revenue. For example, processing of charcoal is an off-season enterprise that may take farmers' attention away from longer-term conservation activities.
All these farm household decisions are influenced by information from outside. The next section is an attempt to group these off-farm factors systematically.

Markets and market channels
Farm Household
Farm families need market information for making investment and marketing decisions. Even though not all farmers do detailed cost-benefit analyses, they usually make a budget "in heads." Often they also make rough budgets on paper before making a decision. Box 5 presents some of the market options that farmers have.
Box 5: Markets and channels
Local
· middlemen
· producers associations
· local industry
Provincial and National
· brokers and traders
· large-scale industries
International
· commodities exchanges
· multinational corporations
Farmers seek market information from other farmers, middlemen, and, if possible, producers associations, retailers, wholesalers, processors, and manufacturers. Unfortunately, access of a small farmer to market information is poor. A competitive market is not always present. Having said this, there is usually great opportunity to improve access to market information and, by doing so, allow farmers to tap into domestic, if not international markets.
Small farmers who are not organized into groups will find it difficult to achieve the scale of production that is demanded by more up-scale markets. Group organization under these conditions, therefore, becomes a key element.
Policies, rules and regulations
Household decisions are also affected by policies, rules, and regulations that are enforced by the state and community. Examples are given in Box 6. These may be implemented either at the local or the national level. For example, teak in most countries requires a permit to be felled and transported. This is a constraint for teak producing farmers who are exploited by unscrupulous officials. Transportation of fuelwood and charcoal is subject to stringent regulations in some places. These laws are, however, necessary to protect public forest resources.
Apart from formal legislation and policies, there are traditional customs and practices that govern management of agricultural lands. User rights are particularly important for farmers who live on the fringes of state forests and have a ready supply of fuelwood.

Support services
External support services are often needed to take advantage of market and production opportunities. Lack of roads for purchase of production material and transport of farm produce to the market is a clear constraint in some locations.
Other factors such as those highlighted in Box 7, however, are also important. Depending on the extension strategy and readiness of the farm household to respond to market forces, different support services will play varying roles. In some instances, farmers associations and cooperatives have played an instrumental role. In other cases direct subsidies for tree planting and management have had an impact.
Box 7: Support services
· Roads and transport
· Cooperatives
· Credit institutions
· Extension services
· Farmers associations
· Supply of seed/planting material and pesticides/fertilizer
· Middlemen, brokers and contracting industry
· Market information services
Technical information
Issues covered under this heading include information on different aspects of growing crops such as propagation techniques, plant protection, nutrient requirements and harvesting technologies. Information can be provided from sources such as successful farmers, researchers, extension workers and private industry (Box 8).
Especially when a farm family is willing to adopt a new production commodity, technical information is essential to prevent failure.
Box 8: Technical information
· Other farmers Research
· Extension
· Industry
· Middlemen
Farm Household
For example: When a farmer decides to produce his own tree seedlings, technical information on how to select seed and seedling is necessary, since usually farmers are used to growing crops with a short rotation. If a plant does not flourish as well as its neighbors' only a little production is lost, since the harvest takes place within a short time-span of only a few months. This way of thinking makes him very conservative in seedling selection, if he applies selection at all. Depending on seed-source an average of two thirds of the seedling many have to thrown away due to poor growing performance. If a less productive seedling is planted for production, time required to produce a harvestable product can be increased by as much as five times. All this time the tree occupies space which could be used for wood production.
Also a lot of production capacity is lost in fruit production, when a farm family uses fruit seeds for their trees instead of grafts. Much rural fruit has an average taste, and comes from average producing trees.
Also techniques developed by neighboring farmers will also be adopted if they proof to be successful. These techniques are designed by people with the same cultural setting as the surrounding farmers, so the process of diffusion will be shorter. An example: in Central Java mango seedlings die on poor soil with a pronounced dry season. An experienced farmer named Pak Maryono found a technique for increasing the survival rate. To avoid superficial root growth he suggests digging a hole 1 x 1 x 1 meter, removing the poor soil and replacing it with fertile soil and organic manure. The next year, he suggests digging 4 to 6 one-meter deep drills around the young tree and adding organic manure. Roots that are enriched with manure from the drills grow downwards and outwards seeking nutrients at deeper soil levels. In this way he could harvest his first mangos in four years. Now many farmers in this area use this rather labour intensive method for their mango trees as well.
In Summary
The interaction between all the of factors discussed above is presented in the following figure. This may be used as a framework for selection of extension strategies or to guide unstructured interviews with farmers to learn how they go about making agroforestry decisions.
