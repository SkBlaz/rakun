1. Introduction
Much attention has been paid recently to the wood wastes of the mechanical forest industry as a potential source of fuel. The rising oil price and the growing risk of disturbances in oil supply are calling for an increased utilization of wood wastes in energy production. At the present price level of fuel oil, wood based power and heat generation seems to be economically justified even in small scale forest industries.
Compared to oil, wood combustion is not an altogether easy thing. Fuel handling is more extensive, the boiler construction is more complicated and to generate the same amount of heat from wood fuel, a bigger boiler is needed than with oil.
As a result, a wood fired power or heat plant is generally more expensive than an oil fired one, and although the relative cheapness of the fuel may lead to considerable savings in operation costs, wood based energy generation is not always the most economical solution.
This study will investigate the feasibility of wood waste utilization in the power and heat generation at small scale forest industry mills in developing countries. The aim is to find out the rate of self-sufficiency to be attained in the energy supply of a mill utilizing the processing wastes of its own.
The subject is limited to concern various hot water and steam applications in generation of industrial heat and power. The energy content of wood wastes could be used in many other ways as well, for instance in flue gas heating or drying, in hot oil boilers and in running prime movers with belt drives instead of electric generators.
These alternative methods have, however, a rather narrow range of application possibilities when compared to water and steam based systems. Therefore, they are not included in this study.
The methodology of the study will be the following:
First, eleven different small scale mills - four sawmills, four panel plants and three integrated plants - are examined. In selecting them the aim has been to cover as wide a range as possible both of output capacities and of different solutions in technical design.
To satisfy the need of thermal and (or) electrical energy of these mills, in a way that makes use of the fuel of their own - i.e. their processing residues - four different basic types of wood fired power and heat plants are presented.
The mills and the plants are all non-existent.
Each of the eleven forest industry mills are equipped with one of the power and heat plants, the size and output of which is adjusted to correspond to the energy demand of the mill. The different combinations will be evaluated both from the technical as well as the economical point of view.
To evaluate the economics of the energy generation based on wood wastes, the generating costs are finally compared with a fuel oil alternative.
All mills and all power and heat plants are designed to conform with the main principle of the Portfolio, i.e. labour intensive solutions and proven technology with a low degree of automation are applied.
The study is divided into three parts as follows:
Part one, chapters 1...3, lists the basic assumption used in calculations and presents the eleven mechanical forest industry mills briefly.
Part two, consisting of chapters 4 to 11, deals with wood combustion equipment. The thermal properties of different types of wood wastes are listed. Wood fired boilers are examined as well as wood gasification equipment and various types of prime movers. Such subjects as water treatment, fuel handling etc. are briefly presented.
The last chapters of the study, making its third part, investigate the technical properties of the power and heat plants. Further the economics of energy generation are calculated case by case for the different forest industry mills.
Calculation prices refer to a specific Far East country. Although the numerical results may not necessarily be valid for other locations, it is, however, felt that the advantage of wood waste combustion within the mechanical forest industry is of the same magnitude in most developing countries.
2. Assumptions
The preparation of this study is based on the following assumptions.
2.1 Location
The plants are non-existing but referred to as if they were located in the Philippines in South-East Asia.
2.2 Infrastructure
It is presumed that the development of the surrounding region has reached such a level, that a small scale forest industry mill can be erected and taken into operation without infrastructural investments.
2.3 Water and Electrical Energy
Fresh water and electrical energy is supplied in required amounts by the public distribution system. If power is generated at the mill and generation exceeds demand the surplus is sold to the public grid. The case of mill operation without connection to the public grid is examined as well.
2.4 Transports
The transport system allows regular transportation of raw material, fuel and manufactured products at reasonable costs.
2.5 Labour
Labour is available in abundance, but there is a lack of people with technical education.
2.6 Production
The industry mills operate 300 days per year. Production efficiency is 90 %, which means that a sawmill with a rated capacity of 30 000 m^3 per year actually produces 27 000 m^3 per year.
The sawmills operate in one shift, the plywood plant in two shifts and the other panel plants in three shifts.
2.7 Energy Demand
The load factor of the industry plants varies between 0.5 and 0.7. This means that average demand for electrical energy is 50...70 % of the maximum power consumption.
The maximum demand for thermal energy exceeds average demand by 20 %.
2.8 Power and Heat Plant Design
The aim has been a simple plant design based on proven technology but with a low degree of automatization. In this way investment costs have been reduced and the demand for highly educated maintenance personnel lessened.
2.9 Fuel
Power and heat plant fuel is primarily wood waste from the mills. It is assumed that there is no alternative use for these wastes and that they are available at no cost.
Some mills have a waste yield, which is not sufficient to cover its fuel demand. In these cases cheap fuel wood, such as logging residues and small-size roundwood, is purchased to fill the demand gap. The fuel wood is hogged before combusting.
Neither the wood used as raw material nor the fuel wood is debarked.
In plant start-ups and shutdowns as well as in cases of high moisture of the fuel wood, light oil is used as an additional fuel. The light oil consumption is estimated at 5 % of total fuel consumption.

3. Description of Some Forest Industry Mills
As mentioned in the introduction, eleven different mechanical forest industry mills are examined in this study. The mills have all some features in common. First, their production capacity is low in comparison with modern mills in industrialized countries. Further, they are designed according to labour-intensive technology, as developing countries generally are scarce in capital but possess large reserves of labour.
When this type of technology is applied it does not only reduce plant investment costs, but has also a lessening influence upon energy consumption per unit. Taking also into account the plant location in the tropical region - reducing the need of heating - energy consumption values are lower than those of, for instance, European mechanical forest industry mills.
In the following pages the forest mills are briefly presented.
3.1 Sawmill, Natural Drying
The two first plants are sawmills. The smaller one has an output capacity of 50 m^3 sawnwood per day and the bigger one is twice that large.
After sawing and trimming, the sawnwood is piled in the open air for drying. For this reason no generation of steam or hot water is needed.
In the following these two plants are referred to as Sawmills No. 1 and 2.

3.2 Sawmill, Kiln Drying
The next two sawmills, referred to as Sawmills No. 3 and 4, are identical to Sawmills 1 and 2 with the exception that the sawnwood is dried in chamber-like kilns. The kilns are heated with hot water entering the kiln at a temperature of 110...120 °C. The kiln air is circulated by fans. Due to the fans the consumption of electrical energy is significantly higher than at sawmills 1 and 2.

3.3 Plywood Plant
Of the four panel plants to be investigated in this study the first one, a plywood plant, is presented here. It is called Panel Plant No. 1.
In general, the panel plants consume more energy than the sawmills and the plywood plant is no exception to this rule. Its most important heat consumers are the veneer dryer, the hot press (requiring a water or steam temperature of 160...200 °C) and the steaming pits.

3.4 Fibreboard Plant
The fibreboard plant. Panel Plant No. 2 has considerable energy costs per output unit. Medium-pressure steam at a temperature of about 200 °C is used in three major phases of the manufacturing process. First the raw material is defibrated by steam treatment in a digester. At a further stage the wet mat is dried and pressed in the hot press, which is heated by steam. Finally the board is given heat treatment in a board dryer, the drying energy of which also is supplied by steam.

The fuel yield is 0.16 m^3 sanding dust per every ton of produced fibreboard.
3.5 Particle Board Plant
Panel Plants No. 3 and 4 are producing 25 respectively 50 m^3 of particle board per day. As raw material the process uses sawmill and plywood manufacturing residues or low grade logs or both.
Main heat consumers are the dryer and the hot press, using steam at a temperature between 140 and 200 °C.

For every m^3 of particle board produced 0.06 m^3 of sawdust is obtained, which can be used as fuel.
Panel Plant No. 3 is designed to be expandable at a later stage to twice its initial capacity. This leads to a rather high power consumption per output unit in the first stage.

3.6 Sawmill Integrated with Plywood and Particle Board Plant
As mentioned in the previous section a particle board plant can operate on the wood waste from a sawmill or a plywood plant. The following mill to be presented is an integrated unit, consisting of a sawmill, a plywood plant and a particle board plant. It is called Integrated Plant No. 1.
The technical data is simply obtained by summing the figures of the units of which the integrated plant consists (cf. sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5).

3.7 Sawmill, Plywood Plant and Particle Board Plant Integrated with Housing Components and Door Manufacture
The next plant. Integrated Plant No. 2, is an extension of the previous one. 20 % of the sawnwood output and some 50 % of the particle board is processed further in a housing components and door manufacturing unit. This department increases the demand of hot water (about 115 °C) by 700 kW and the consumption of electrical energy by 170 kW compared with Integrated Plant No. 1.

Taking into consideration the further processing of part of the sawnwood and the particle board, the raw material balance is otherwise the same as in section 3.6.
3.8 Plywood and Veneer Plant integrated with a Particle Board Plant
The last mechanical forest industry mill in this chapter is a plywood and veneer plant combined with particle board manufacturing. The plants are identical to those presented in the Portfolio studies on Plywood Plants and Fibreboard Plants (by Doffine-Consult GmbH and Fahrni Institut AG) and are referred to as Integrated Plant No. 3.
The veneer process differs from the plywood process by its shorter manufacturing line: the veneer is extracted immediately after the dryer, while there is a greater number of phases in the plywood process.

3.9 Summary on the Mechanical Forest Industry Plants
To conclude this chapter the forest industry mills are listed in table 3.1, where their technical characteristics are compared.
The kW-columns under the headings consumption of electrical/thermal energy indicate the average consumption of electricity and heat of the industrial process.
Table 3.2 shows the ways in which the industry mills will be combined with the various power and heat plants. The energy generation costs are calculated for these combinations.
Note that at the present stage of technology wood based power generation at Sawmills No. 1 and 2 is not possible in an economically acceptable way. For these mills the energy costs are calculated only for the case, where the power is supplied by the public grid.

4. Thermal Properties of Wood and Wood Wastes
When evaluating the properties of a combustible material with respect to its applicability as a fuel, the heating value is one of the most important figures. The heating value indicates how much thermal energy is obtained by combusting one mass unit of the material.
In the case of wood and wood wastes, the heating value depends on the species of wood in question, on the part of the tree which is used (core, bark or the tree as a whole) and on the moisture content. The upper limit of the heating value of 100 % dry wood is 18...20 MJ/kg. In practice, the moisture of wood at the moment of logging is about 50 %. Depending on transporting and storing methods and conditions it may rise to 65 % or sink to some 30 % measured at the mill. (Moisture given on wet basis Cf. p. 2)
The moisture of the manufacturing wastes of the mill depends on at what stage of the process the waste is extracted and whether there has been any drying of the wood before this stage. For instance, sanding dust from panel manufacturing is taken from the mill after the driers and the hot presses. Hence, its moisture could be as low as 15 %.
In table 4.1 the heating values of different types of wood fuel at different moisture contents are listed. They can be compared with the values of fuel oil at the bottom of the table.

In the fuel cost calculations later in this study the fuel moisture is assumed to be 50 %. When manufacturing wastes are used moisture values below this are often obtained. The calculated consumption of fuel wood is thus to be regarded as an upper limit, which hardly will be exceeded in practice.
The following table is based on the data on waste yield of the different mechanical forest industry mills as presented in chapter 3. It indicates how much energy is received in the form of wood wastes per unit of manufactured product. Wood moisture is assumed to be 50 %.

5. Wood Waste Burning Equipment
The existing equipment for burning wood or wood is as follows:
- fixed flat grates (Dutch ovens, underfeed stokers)
- fixed cone grates
- mechanical flat grates (dumping grates, vibragrates, reciprocating grates)
- inclined and sloping grates (including step grates)
- travelling grates
- Z-grates
- combined sloping and mechanical grates
- cyclons
- fluidized beds
- suspension firing in the main furnace
- combined suspension and grate combustion
Those mentioned after the travelling grates are not dealt with here. They are either suited for capacity ranges which exceed the scope of this study, or they represent a technology which is too sophisticated (and expensive) to be recommended for operation in developing countries.
5.1 Fixed Flat Grate
The oldest system to burn wood or bark in industry is to burn it in a pile. The pile may stand on a grate or, on a brick floor. The pile is normally fired in a furnace which will result in stable combustion and higher combustion capacity. The furnace (which is often a Dutch oven) often works only as a gas generator, and the combustion is completed in the boiler, to which the furnace is connected.
The following figure No. 5.1 shows a Dutch oven with a flat grate. Normally a Dutch oven consists of two compartments which are separated with a center wall so that one of the compartment may be ashed during firing of the other. Fuel is normally fed from the top of the oven and forms a pile about 1...1.5 m high.
Figure 5.1 Flat grate in a Dutch oven.
In modern applications of the Dutch oven the grate is replaced by a solid floor.
Load control is performed by regulating the flow of combustion air. Maximum fuel moisture is 67 %. The Dutch oven is simple, reliable, troublefree (if designed with adequate space) and cheap. Drawbacks of the system are maintenance costs (refractory), poor response to load changes and strong ash and carbon carry over when overloaded. The Dutch oven requires continuous operation to maintain high combustion rate (continuous fuel feed).
Figure 5.2 shows an underfeed stoker for wood or wood waste. The fuel is fed into the furnace by a screw located under the grate. Maximum fuel size is approximately 65 x 10 x 10 mm.
Figure 5.2 Underfeed stoker with screw feeder.
When compared with a Dutch oven the advantage of a underfeed stoker is that the top of the pile is not cooled by cold and moist fuel or by cold air. On the other hand, if the pile is tight the air cannot penetrate the pile surface causing drying problems at the centre of the pile. For this reason underfeed stokers are suited for rather dry fuel. (Max. 40...45 %.)
Figure 5.3 A fire tube boiler equipped with a membrane screen and a plane grate in a refractory combustion chamber (Lambion).
Modern plane grates are water cooled pinhole grates. They are constructed by turning boiler tubes to form a floor near the bottom of the furnace and by laying grate bars on top of the tubes. The bars are equipped with pinholes for inlet of combustion air. The main advantage of this type of grate is its cheapness. Its drawbacks are:
- ashing limits grate using time to 20...22 h/d
- auxiliary fuel is required when fuel moisture exceeds 55 %
- plenty of maintenance is required.
5.2 Fixed Cone Grates
Several small grates belong to this category. The grate is normally in a refractory combustion chamber or it is part of it. The systems are basically identical to those in the previous section except the shape of the grate.
Conical grates are suited for fuels with higher moisture than flat grates. The fuel is normally fed by an under-feed stoker (cf. figure 5.4), but dry fuel could be fed from above as well (figure 5.5).
Figure 5.4 Refractory furnace and underfeed stoker.
Figure 5.5 Above-fed cone grate.
5.3 Mechanical Flat Grates
Figure 5.6 Dumping grate.
The dumping grate stoker is usually applied in small or medium sized units. It is a stationary grate (see figure 5.6) made up of grate bars, mechanically linked so that they can be rotated 90 degrees to dump ash. One section could be shut off for ashing while the combustion continues in the other sections.
Figure 5.7 Vibragrate for wood waste.
The vibragrate (figure 5.7) has been used in USA for burning wood waste. The combustion capacity is somewhat higher than with a dumping grate. The fuel bed slides down the grate as it is subjected to intermittent vibrations originating from a motor-driven eccentric drive at the front of the grate. The fuel dries and burns as it moves down the grate and the ash is discharged into a hopper at the front of the unit.
Figure 5.8 Kablitz-grate
A reciprocating grate is normally constructed slightly inclining. Figure 5.8 shows such a grate (Kablitz). The Kablitz grate is divided into separate sections, each of which is equipped with a drive of its own. The advantage of a reciprocating grate is its suitability in combustion of "difficult" fuels, such as bark. On the other hand its price is rather high.
5.4 Inclined and Sloping Grates
Sloping grates are widely used in modern bark or wood waste fired boilers. Although there exist some minor differences in design - horizontal or longitudinal grate bars, even or changing inclination etc. - the principle of operation is roughly the same for all inclined and sloped grates. The fuel is fed to the top of the grate from where it slides downwards. While sliding the fuel first dries and then ignites and burns. The ash is deposited at the bottom of the grate.
In some designs additional grates are added after the sloped grate for completion of the combustion or for ashing purposes. These designs are, however, rather expensive.
Maximum fuel moisture is 55...65 % depending on the grate design. Grates with horizontal bars, so-called step grates, are, however, suited only for rather dry fuels.
The ashing of a sloped grate is done manually or automatically. Ashing is required once per shift but with modern grates the interval may be even a week.
Figure 5.9 Underfloor furnace with a step grate and a fire tube boiler (Lambion).
5.5 Travelling Grates
Especially in North America wood and wood waste is often burned on travelling grate spreader stokers. The fuel is thrown into the furnace through feeders located 1...4 meters above the grate. The fuel falls onto the travelling grate, it dries, ignites and burns. The ash is conveyed to the front of the grate from where it falls into the ash pit.
Depending on how much the combustion air is preheated the maximum fuel moisture is between 40 and 55 %.
The main advantages of the travelling grate system is its versatility and great combustion capacity. Several different fuels may be burned on it and ash removal is continuous.
On the other hand travelling grates are subject to mechanical problems, which cause high maintenance costs.
Figure 5.10 Water tube boiler (Yoshimine) with spreader stoker and travelling grate.
6. Boilers
When wood fired boilers are compared with oil or gas fired ones, the biggest differences exist in the combustion equipment. As oil and gas can be combusted in burners of rather simple design, the previous chapter showed clearly the extensiveness of the equipment that is needed in combustion of solid fuels, such as wood and wood waste.
In the rest of the boiler, however, there are only a few minor differences in design between boilers fired with solid fuels and those fired with oil or gas. One major difference is that generally more combustion air is needed with solid fuels than with oil, which leads to bigger amounts of flue gases and also to a bigger boiler volume. To turn it the other way round, with a given boiler a bigger output is obtained by oil firing than by wood firing, presuming that combustion of both is possible.
There is also another difference. Wood has a bigger ash content than oil and this requires more extensive ash removal, both from the furnace and from the flue gases.
On the whole, a wood fired boiler does not differ from an oil fired one in very many respects. For this reason, it is possible to change a boiler, that initially has been designed for oil combustion to wood combustion. As was mentioned earlier, the result will, however, be a lower boiler output.
For the reasons listed above, this chapter provides quite a brief presentation of boilers. Two questions will be dealt with: The different heat transfer mediums and the major types of boiler designs. The presentation is limited to boilers that are suited for industrial application of small scale mills.
6.1 Heat Transfer Medium
In choosing the heat transfer medium of a boiler there are three main alternatives:
- hot water
- steam
- hot oil
6.1.1 Hot Water
Because of the fact, that the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure is 100 °C the water system of a warm water boiler must be pressurized. The needed pressure rises sharply with temperature requirements. For instance, to reach a temperature of 200 °C the water side pressure must constantly be maintained over 16 bar. The main applications of industrial water boilers are therefore at mills with low temperature requirements, roughly between 100 °C and 140 °C. One example is a sawmill with drying kilns (cf. section 3.2)
6.1.2 Steam
Steam is used where heat is needed at higher temperatures (150 °C...200 °C) and in applications that include steam turbines or steam engines. A steam boiler is generally more expensive than a water boiler and requires a more extensive water treatment system. On the other hand, to transfer the same amount of heat a smaller mass flow is needed with steam than with water, which could lead to savings in piping costs.
6.1.3 Hot Oil
To use oil as heat transfer medium instead of steam or water, will give some significant advantages. First, temperatures as high as 300 °C and over could be reached without pressurizing the system. This gives both better operation safety and simple design. Second, no water treatment is needed.
A temperature of 200 °C could be regarded to be the lower temperature limit for economical operation with hot oil.
In panel manufacturing the temperature requirements of the dryers and hot presses are of this magnitude. In some small scale plants, however, the equipment is designed to operate at a lower temperature level.
Some drawbacks are connected with hot oil operation. If the boiler is not carefully designed the oil may crack (change its chemical composition) and at length cause tube failures. Further, tube leaks may lead to considerable damage while the heat transfer medium is highly combustible. Finally, hot oil has a rather low specific heat and requires wider pipes than a water or steam heat transfer system.
6.2 Boiler Design Types
Although there is a multitude of different boiler designs the main operation principle is common for them all. Fuel is combusted to release heat, which is transferred from the flue gases to the heat transfer medium. All boilers operate this way regardless of what fuel is applied, how and where it is combusted or what heat transfer medium is used.
When the combustion equipment - which was presented in the previous chapter - is excluded, the boilers could be divide into two groups according to design features. These are:
- flame-fire tube boilers
- water tube boilers
6.2.1 Flame-fire Tube Boilers
In a flame-fire tube boiler the hot flue gases flow inside the boiler tubes heating (evaporating) the medium outside the tubes. Depending on tube configuration, the flue gases flow through the boiler one to four times before leaving through the stack. Correspondingly, the boilers are called one-pass boilers, two-pass boilers etc. A three-pass boiler is shown in figure 6.1.
Flame-fire tube boilers are supplied for a wide range of capacities. Some boiler companies offer flame-fire tube boilers for water, steam and superheated steam from 170 kW to 18 000 kW or 250 kg/h to 28 t/h of output capacity. The pressure range of these boilers is 1.5...29 bar.
6.2.2 Water Tube Boilers
As the name indicates, the water - or whatever medium is applied - flows inside the tubes of a water tube boiler and, hence, the combustion gases on the outside. This is shown in figure 6.2.
In steam generation with small size water tube boilers - 15 t/h of st
