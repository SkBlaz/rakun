<title>Consultancy report on first extension staff training in horticulture</title>
<section>1</section>
Summary
This consultancy mission has been executed within the framework of the FAO Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS) - Smallholder Irrigation and Water Use Programme -Irrigation component. The aim was to train camp extension officers and block extension officers on improved horticultural practices and Integrated Plant Nutrition Systems in the SPFS field sites involving five provinces Lusaka, Central, Southern, Western and Eastern. The mission commenced on March 1 and ended on April 30,1998.
During the mission, FAO SPFS horticultural documents were reviewed to provide background information on the training needs. A brief on improved horticultural practices was presented to the technical staff during the first Technical Staff Training one on March 18, 1998. The technical officers agreed on the implementation of the first extension staff training one. Training materials were prepared in form of notes, reprints and slides.
The actual training was conducted over three days period in each province from March 30 to April 30, 1998. A total of 99 extension/block extension officers and 24 technical officers attended the training. The participants were trained in basic horticulture covering the following elements: introduction to horticulture, vegetable production systems, limiting factors of vegetable production (biotic and abiotic), improved practices such as site selection, nursery management, variety choice, seed rates, land preparation, fertiliser application, weeding, pests and diseases and marketing strategies. Field visits to vegetable gardens were undertaken as part of training activities in order to relate the actual farmers practices to what have been recommended.
Through a process of problem identification and solution finding, the extension officers agreed on the key subjects and workplan for training farmers in the respective field sites in provinces.
The participants found the horticultural training to be good, adequate and comprehensive. The training offered sufficient hand-on practical knowledge and skills to extension officers. The participants felt a great need for more of such training workshops.
The following elements were proposed to be incorporated in the next extension staff training two.
· More practical time on management of specific vegetable crops - cabbage, rape, tomato, onion, melons, paprika, and pumpkins.
· Physical identification of pests and diseases and management.
· Physical identification of soil type and use of fertilisers.
· More practical time on irrigation techniques, operation and maintenance of pumps.

Introduction
The consultancy was executed within the framework of the Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS), Small-holder Water Use and Irrigation component in Zambia. The objectives were to train extension officers on improved horticultural practices and Integrated Plant Nutrition Systems (IPNS). The tasks to be accomplished were:
(i) To review SPFS documents on improved horticultural practices and derive practical applications for small-holder farmers.
(ii) To prepare training material suitable for extension staff and farmers on improved horticultural practicals.
(iii) To prepare a briefing for Technical Services Branch Staff on improved horticultural practices.
(iv) To conduct training courses for extension staff (EST1) in five provinces Lusaka, Central, Southern, Eastern and Western.
(v) To support the execution of Farmers Training on horticultural practices.
The exercise commenced on first March to review FAO/SPFS horticultural documents and preparation of teaching material. The review of the SPFS documents assisted to identify the current horticultural practices by the small holders. The constraints and gaps to improved horticultural practices were identified. A brief on improved horticultural practices was prepared and presented to the technical staff during the first Technical Staff Training on 18th March, 1998. The topics for the first extension Staff Training (EST1) on improved horticultural practices were presented and discussed. The Technical Officers discussed and agreed on the implementation of the first extension staff training for the five provinces.

Basic understanding of horticulture
Review of effects of physical factors of the environment on horticultural crops
Other factors internal to plants
Socio-economic factors
Classification of vegetable crops
Vegetable production systems
Review of effects of physical factors of the environment on horticultural crops
Temperature
Light
Rainfall
Wind
Soils
Biotic factors
The factors that were lectures and discussed included:
Abiotic factors.
Weather and climate. Each horticultural crop has certain climatic requirements. Unfavourable weather and climatic conditions produce a stress. Components of weather and climate include:
Temperature
Temperature influences all physiological activities by controlling
- Phytosynthesis
- Respiration
- Enzymic activity
- Organic matter decomposition
- Microbial growth and development
- Flowering
- Pollen viability
- Fruit set
- Hormonal balance
- Rate of maturation
- Rate of senescence
- Quality
- Yield
- Shelf life
- Harvest duration
- Vernalization of biennials
- Seed germination
- Root development
- Water and nutrient absorption
- Pests and disease occurrence
Extremes of temperatures
- Frost damage at 0 °C
- Chilling injury 0 - 2 °C or lower but above freezing point.
Light
Photosynthesis uses light. Light intensity and duration are important for crop growth and development. Low light causes plants to be spindly, small leaves, bud blades, poor pollination and poor fruit quality.
Plants differ in light requirements. An example was given for horticultural crops.
- Light affects pollen viability and fruit set.
- Certain seed require light to break dormancy e.g. lettuce.
- Some horticultural crops are sensitive to protoperiod.
Examples were given.
- Short day plants flower rapidly when the days get shorter.
- Long day plants flower when days are longer.
- Short days hasten tuber formation in potatoes, root enlargement in sweet potatoes.
- Long days and high temperatures keep plants in staminate (phase) in Cucurbits.
Light intensity and duration are important for crop growth and development:
- Photosynthesis uses light
- Low light causes plants to be long and this (spindly), small leaves, bud blades, poor pollination and poor fruit quality.
- Photosynthesis is stopped at high light intensity depending on species.
- Plants differ in light requirements.
- Certain seeds require light and break dormancy.
- Some plants are sensitive to photoperiod or day length.
- Short day plants flower rapidly when the days get shorter.
- Long day plants flower when days are longer.
- Short days hasten tuber formation in potato, root enlargement in sweet potatoes.
- Long days and high temps keep plants in staminate (phase) in cucurbits.
Rainfall
- Water comprises more than 80% of the living plants, providing structural integrity for the plant.
- Rainfall natural source of water.
- Water is a major determinant of crop productivity and quality.
- Required in large quantities for plant growth than any other of the growth factor.
- Solvent for nutrients, minerals, etc..
- Water improves the germination of seeds.
- Essential to establish transplanted seedlings.
- Essential for faster establishment of the crop.
- Essential to facilitate application and distribution of fertilizers and pesticides.
- Provides protection in cold temp (frost).
- Facilitates harvesting of underground crops in dry soils.
- Cooling of the leaves during respiration.
- All crops have moisture range at which crop response is optimum. Examples were given.
- Crop differ in their tolerance of continuous wet conditions.
- Hydrophytes - aquatic.
- Mesophytes - most common of terrestrial plants.
- Xerophytes - can endure long period.
- Root systems affect the amount of water uptake..
Negative aspects of rainfall
- Waterlogging
- Drought
- Storms
Wind
- A slight wind is necessary to replenish Carbondioxide near plant surface.
- Wind carries oxygen away from the plant.
- Less wind, less evaporation, less water requirement.
- Wind can be a limiting factor in vegetables production where strong winds (a ver. Wind speed of 7.2 km/hr) occur e.g. Typhoons (wind speed of 60 km/hr)
- Use of windbreaks (shelter belts) minimize damage, a relatively slow wind.
- Dusting plants - affects rate of photosynthesis of coating the photosynthesizing leaves and green stem.
- May blow away pests and diseases thus carry pests to or away from crop.
- May interfere with farm operations e.g. spraying, etc..
- May aid in pollination.
Soils
Horticultural crops are adapted to a wide range of soil types at times with specific requirements. Soils particle types include clay 0.002 mm or less, silt 0.05 to 0.002 mm and sand 0.05 mm or above. Aspects of soil fertility and soil pH were discussed. Organic and inorganic fertilizers as source of nutrients were also discussed.
Biotic factors
- Insect pests
- Bacteria
- Fungi
- Nematodes
- Viruses
- Weeds
- Domestic and wild animals
Other factors internal to plants
- Leaf structure
- Chlorophyll content
- Water conducting ability
- Osmotic adjustment
- Presence of strong sinks
Socio-economic factors
- Poor road network
- Lack of credit facilities
- Poor marketing systems
- Poor education background
- Lack of availability of inputs-seeds, fertilisers, pesticides.
- Inadequate information on prices of inputs and produce.

b. Indigenous vegetables (Amaranthus, Cleome)
The implications of each classification was discussed in relation to crop management.
Vegetable production systems
To expose participants to the different vegetable production systems.
· Home garden, nutrition garden, community garden as source of food, nutrients.
· Market gardens
· Processing garden
· Truck gardening
· Export gardens
· Protected gardening
· Nursery gardening
· Seed production garden
· Vegetable forcing
Comment: The above topics were aimed at providing a perspective of the major practical applications of factors that would enhance production of horticultural crops. The objective was to develop an extended and in-depth understanding of the principal factors so as to be able to manipulate them to optimise vegetable production. Practical examples were given and discussed. Questions were solicited and discussed. This part of the EST1 was basically a lecture and appeared to be the most challenging to make the camp/block extension officers understand. A lot of practical examples on improved horticultural practices and Integrated Plant Nutrition Systems were given. The participants were very keen and appreciated these basic topics.
<section>7</section>
Review of vegetable production by participants
A review of vegetable production was discussed in groups by participants in their respective camps. The participants brought out any issues on small-holder farmers practices. The camp/block extension officers actively followed the discussions and I was able to make suggestions and give clarifications. Later I presented a brief outline on the current horticultural practices by smallholders summarising the following:- site selection, cultivar choice, nursery management, organic and inorganic fertiliser management, land preparation, irrigation, pest and disease management, post-harvest handling and marketing. The major constraints and gaps were outlined.
<section>8</section>
Field visit to vegetable growers
In order to further elaborate on the topics presented and have farmers practice in the application of the camp/block extension officers, practical field visits were undertaken to vegetable growers. The participants enjoyed the field visits. The field visits were extremely popular for practical demonstration of farmers practices. The differences between the farmers, present practices and recommended practices were discussed in the field. The following elements were observed in the field:
· Poor land tillage at times.
· Basal dressing fertiliser applied late and not incorporated.
· Manure applied as top dressing and not incorporated in the soil.
· Indiscriminate use of insecticides and fungicides.
· Inadequate knowledge on identification of pests and diseases.
· Lack of rotation, poor spacing.
· Growing of fewer vegetable species resulting in market gluts, poor rotation.
· Poor sanitation in vegetable gardens, neglected old crops.
· Farmers do not use compost.
· Marketing problems.
· Farmers use recycled seed.
· Poor irrigation techniques.
<section>9</section>
Improved vegetable production practices
Examples of improved production techniques for major vegetable crops, tomato, cabbage, rape, onion, okra and cucurbits were discussed. The techniques covered were:-
· Land/site selection: To take into account crop adaptation to soils, climate and market considerations.
· Seed/cultivar choice: Sources of seed, characteristics of good seed, advantages of using high quality seed, adaptability, market suitability, seasonal adaptation, resistance to diseases, disadvantages of using recycled seeds.
· Nursery Management: Nursery as an intensive care unit, nursery requirements - site selection, rotation, good sanitation, irrigation, fertilizer needs, pest and disease management.
· Land preparation for vegetables: Importance of good tilth, different tillage systems raised beds, farrows, flat beds, basics. Suitability of tillage systems according to season, soil types, irrigation methods respectively.
· Fertilisers: Sources of nutrients - organic (compost, green and cattle manures) and inorganic fertilizers. Nutrient requirements of vegetables to determine yields and quality. The importance of following fertiliser recommendations in relation to amounts, timing and placement. Options for improving soil fertility using green manure crops, compost and livestock manure. Handling manure and application of manure. The concept of Integrated Plant Nutrition Systems was introduced. The concept aims at maintaining or adjusting of soil fertility and plant nutrient supply to sustain a desired level of crop production. This is to be achieved through the following:
a. Balanced use of mineral fertilisers combined with organic and biological sources of plant nutrients.
b. Improving and maintaing the stock of plant nutrients in the soils.
c. Improving efficiency use of plant nutrients by avoiding losses to the environment.
· Seed rates: The implications of using recommended seed rates were discussed.
· Spacing: The importance of using optimum spacings for high yields were emphasised.
· Crop rotation: The implications of good crop rotations to minimise pests and disease build up and to enhance soil fertility were discussed.
· Irrigation: The functions of water in horticultural crops were reviewed. Moisture requirements for different crops and critical growth stages to avoid moisture stress were discussed. Soil moisture management in the nursery and direct seeded crops such as okra, beans and peas. Use of mulch to conserve soil moisture.
· Staking: The importance if staking tomatoes to avoid diseases was discussed.
· Pruning: Essential to enhance fruit quality in indeterminate tomato cultivars.
· Pest and disease management: This is the biggest problem in vegetable production. Proper pest and disease identification was emphasised. A list of the major vegetable pests and diseases was presented and discussed. The concept of integrated pest management was reviewed. Integrated approach to pest/disease management involving cultural, biological, cultivar resistance and use of pesticides. Effects of cultural techniques on pests and diseases were discussed. Chemical control of vegetable pests and diseases. Judicious use of pesticide, effects of pesticides on environment and humans.
· Weeding: The importance of weeding was emphasised avoid competition for space, nutrients, water. Certain weeds like Nicandra are alternate hosts for red spidermites.
· Post harvest handling: The following were discussed: proper harvesting methods, time of harvest, care in handling of produce, use of field storage sheds, proper packaging materials, treatment of produce and grading of produce.
· Marketing of horticultural crops: Marketing decisions should be made before planting the crop. Some marketing strategies discussed include; knowing the market requirements, when to sale, timing, off-season production, formation of association for better bargaining, formation of marketing days to create awareness, market research and crop diversification.

<section>e</section>
Comments/conclusions
The first extension staff training (EST1) was carried out successfully in five provinces to commensurate with the laid down tasks and time frame. A total of 99 camp/block extension officers and 24 technical officers were trained in basic horticulture and Integrated Plant Nutrition Systems. The trainees were trained in basic knowledge and skills required for successful vegetable production. Sufficient hand-on practicals were given to the trainees.
The relevant topics on vegetable production site selection, nursery management, cultivar choice, land preparation, seed rate, spacing, weeding, fertiliser, pests and diseases and marketing were covered. There was active participation of the extension officers. The extension officers found the training to be adequate and useful.
There is great need to train extension officers whose qualifications are mostly at certificate level and with little experience in horticulture. It would be useful to incorporate the following elements in the next extension staff training:
· More practical time on management of specific vegetable crops - cabbage, rape, tomato, onions, melons, paprika, pumpkins.
· Physical identification of pests and diseases and management.
· Physical identification of soil types and use of fertilisers.
· Planning a horticultural garden.
· More practical time on irrigation techniques, operation and maintenance pumps.
