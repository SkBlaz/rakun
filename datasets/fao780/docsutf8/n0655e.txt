<section>1</section>
ABSTRACT
Sixteen participants, from ten countries (Bangladesh, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand) attended a Training Course in Fish Feed Technology held in Seattle, State of Washington, U.S.A. The Course was organized and conducted by the FAO/UNDP Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme in collaboration with the College of Fisheries, University of Washington.
Training activities included lectures, tutorials, laboratory work, country problems discussions and field visits. Eighty-two lectures on subjects dealing with: digestion anatomy and physiology, nutritional bio-energetics and biochemistry, feed-stuffs, feed formulation, feed milling technology, practical diets and quality control, were presented by specialists. All the participants described the status of intensive aquaculture in their respective countries and the constraints on its development with particular reference to feed supply and diet development.

1. GENERAL
Introduction

Participants
Introduction
Feed is one of the major inputs in aquaculture and often the success of fish farming depends to a very large extent on the provision of adequate quantities of nutritionally suitable feeds in a form in which fish can utilize. Even in types of aquaculture where the main source of nutrition is natural food, produced by fertilization or other means, supplemental feeding with artificial feeds is necessary to obtain increased production. In many developing countries agricultural or fisheries wastes are used to feed fish but a good proportion of the feed offered is wasted as they are not in a form in which fish can utilize. Such unused feed may sometimes serve as fertilizer but may more often cause the pollution of water and consequently unfavourable conditions for the growth and survival of the stock. While the availability of suitable feed is important in obtaining growth and survival and production of adult fish, it is of greater and crucial importance in the rearing of larvae
and fry. The absence of adequate artificial feeds for these early stages of fish is a major handicap to aquaculture development. At present aquaculturists have to depend largely on uncertain supplies of natural food organisms such as Artemia, which have to be imported in many countries at considerable cost.
Fish feeds have been developed in some countries notably Japan, Sweden and the U.S.A. for salmonid fishes, catfish and shrimps. In most cases the formulations are propietary secrets and are far too expensive for use in developing countries. The high cost of some of the feed ingredients like fish meal has been a problem even in industrially advanced countries and so considerable research is now underway to find suitable substitutes.
Recognizing the need for developing suitable feeds based on locally available inexpensive ingredients, FAO through UNDP-sponsored projects has assisted some countries to undertake surveys of the availability of feed ingredients, and formulation, preparation and testing of feeds. These assistance projects have yielded very encouraging results. Many developing countries have started animal feed manufacturing industries and if the necessary expertise becomes available and a sizeable demand for fish feeds is created through the popularization of economical feeds, the animal feed manufacturers are sure to initiate large-scale production of fish feeds. The major bottleneck at present is the lack of necessary expertise to formulate, prepare and test appropriate feeds and demonstrate their nutritional and economic value. The FAO Technical Conference on Aquaculture held in Kyoto, Japan in 1976, recognized this as a major constraint on aquaculture development and recommended early
remedial action. Training facilities in fish feed technology are very limited indeed as the feed industry is largely in the private sector.
In view of the above, the FAO/UNDP Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP) decided to organize a specialized Training Course in Fish Feed Technology at the College of Fisheries, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington State, U.S.A., for qualified candidates from selected developing countries. The course was designed as the first phase of a feed development programme to be implemented in the next two to three years, utilizing the personnel trained, as focal points in their respective countries.
The long-range objective of the project was to spread the practice of intensive, high-yielding aquaculture.
The immediate objective was to create the core of experts needed in developing countries to initiate programmes of feed ingredient surveys, practical diet formulation, processing and testing of fish feeds for species of fish and shellfish currently cultivated.
Organization
The Course was organized in the Spring of 1978 in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. by FAO in cooperation with the College of Fisheries, University of Washington. It was intended to be a post-graduate level course consisting of scheduled lectures, tutorials and laboratory sessions conducted by lecturers of the College of Fisheries and guest lecturers from other teaching and research institutions in the U.S.A. (see Annex I and III).
Dr. John E. Halver, Professor of Fish Nutrition, College of Fisheries, University of Washington, served as the Director of the Course and Dr. Ronald Hardy, Assistant Research Professor of the College as the Liaison Officer. Dr. Kai W. Chow, Fish Feed Technologist of the FAO/UNDP Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme was the Co-Director of the Course and responsible for programme inputs and general administration.
The production of economical and efficient fish feeds involves knowledge of nutritional biochemistry, digestion physiology, feed ingredient utilization, least cost formulation techniques, practical diet formulation and feed manufacturing technology. The Course was, therefore, organized around these topics. As practical work was to be emphasized, class visits to feed mills, feed ingredient processing plants and fisheries research stations in northwestern United States and British Columbia, Canada, formed an important part of the Course.
In order that the Course could be efficiently conducted for the maximum benefit of the trainees and for immediate use of countries, participation was restricted to selected English-speaking countries that have aquaculture programmes requiring artificial feeds.
Participants
A total of 16 candidates were selected for participation in the Course from the following ten countries that sent in nominations: Bangladesh, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand (see Annex II).
Almost all the trainees had more than four years' experience in fisheries science (aquaculture included) in their home environment. One was an instructor in aquacultural science at a university.

3. FISH FEED DEVELOPMENT IN THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES
Bangladesh
Egypt
Ghana
Indonesia
Kenya
Nepal
Nigeria
The Philippines
Sri Lanka
Thailand
During country problems discussions and in response to a prepared questionnaire, all the sixteen trainees described the status of intensive aquaculture in their respective countries and the constraints on its development with particular reference to feed supply and diet development. The current status of aquaculture development in each of the ten countries represented has been the subject of recent FAO regional workshops on aquaculture planning and has been described in programme documents ADCP/REP/75/1 and ADCP/REP/76/2.
All ten countries have extensive bodies of inland and coastal waters where aquaculture can be practised on both an intensive as well as on an extensive scale. Feed constitutes the major input in intensive aquaculture and the success of fish farming depends to a large extent on the provision of adequate quantities of nutritionally adequate feeds in utilizable forms.
The countries represented range from those that have traditional surpluses of good quality feedstuffs supporting thriving domestic livestock industries to countries where such supplies are extremely scarce.
The following are summaries of statements made by trainees concerning each country's prospects for meeting feed requirements for intensive aquaculture:
Bangladesh
Intensive fish culture in Bangladesh is hampered by serious shortages of essential feed ingredients. Grains, root crops and tubers are all staple foods and are reserved for human consumption. Conventional feedstuffs such as fish meal and rice bran are in short supply and aggressively sought after by the more established livestock and poultry industries. Due to these shortages and because of the lack of expertise the compound feed industry is underdeveloped. Prospects for early development of artificial diets for intensive fish (primarily carp) culture do not appear bright. Nevertheless.,' research in fish nutrition and feed efficiency studies have been initiated at the Fisheries Technological Research Station at Chandpur aimed at developing fish diets using available feed ingredients.
Egypt
Egypt is another country where the shortage of experienced personnel and the absence of a well-developed feed processing industry are major constraints on intensive aquaculture. There appears to be an adequate supply of some basic feed ingredients such as rice bran and cottonseed meal that can be used for preparing artificial diets for certain freshwater species. Other feedstuffs available in more limited quantities and also suitable as components of fish diets include wheat bran, fish meal, brewers' grains and slaughter-house waste. The chemical laboratory at the General Egyptian Organization for Aquatic Resources in Nasr City, Cairo, carries out routine water analysis for fish farms and has also initiated fish feed formulation activities. The Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries in Cairo is conducting research on the development of a process for converting sewage sludge to feed suitable for fish and poultry. Digestibility studies on various feed ingredients are also
being planned.
Ghana
The principal food crops in Ghana are cassava, maize and bananas. These are consumed primarily by the human population and there are few other crops which are grown in sufficient quantities for use as livestock feed. The only animal feed mill (part of a large food processing complex) located in Accra is not in operation. As a result there is no feed processing industry in the country. The expanding marine fishery industry may, however, be a potential source of fish meal that can be used for both livestock and fish culture.
Indonesia
Indonesia was a traditional supplier of rice bran and copra meal to neighbouring Southeast Asian countries. With the recent expansion of animal husbandry in the country, however, this surplus is being used up by domestic demand. The country also produces large quantities of cassava, some maize and oil seeds. Fish farmers, operating on relatively small scale, compete with the more established livestock and poultry farmers and the growing number of feed mills for limited supplies of feedstuffs. Given the higher profitability and the traditional consumer preference for fish there is scope for the development of intensive fish culture in the country involving the use of artificial diets, despite a tight feed ingredient supply situation. The UNDP-funded Brackishwater Aquaculture Development Centre in Jepara has a programme for the development of artificial diets for milkfish and shrimp. Problems in Macrobrachium culture, suspected to be nutritional, have recently been encountered
at Jepara but have not been identified conclusively. The shrimp appearing to be feeding well on prepared diet had flaccid musculature which did not fill up the exoskeleton. Meat texture was adversely affected although mortality rate was not significantly increased. The Inland Fisheries Research Institute at Bogor performs routine chemical analysis of feedstuffs and feed formulation, and conducts feeding experiments with carp and tilapia. Studies on fish silage as a substitute for fish meal has also been initiated at Bogor.
Kenya
Maize, millet, cassava and sweet potatoes are the major food crops in Kenya. They are also staple foods for the human population and there is little surplus of these and other crops for animal production. As a result, the livestock feed industry and the associated technology are not well developed. Although trout farming has proven highly profitable due to high demand and limited production the severe shortage of suitable feed ingredients is a serious impediment to progress toward fish culture on an intensive scale.
Nepal
Nepal is self-sufficient in food cereals and mill by-products such as rice bran and wheat bran, as well as maize meal, are available for fish feeding. Oil seeds are not grown in sufficient quantities in the country and the major protein source for fish diets is imported fish meal. The lack of domestic sources of protein feed has been and will continue to be a major constraint in the development of the feed milling industry. Farmed fish, primarily carp, are currently produced without much supplemental feeding due to low stocking density and because of the absence of suitable artificial diets. The government-operated Hetauda Commercial Fish Farm at Makwanpur is experimenting with supplemental feeding methods using an assortment of locally available feed ingredients. Plan are also being made to install a pellet mill for producing experimental pelleted diets.
Nigeria
The principal food crop in Nigeria is cassava, some of which is used for the feeding of farm animals. Domestic production of food grains include sorghum, millet, maize and rice, practically all of which are for human consumption. Vegetable protein sources available for animal feeding include groundnut, cottonseed and palm kernel cakes. Supplies of oil seed cakes are limited, however, and their availability for domestic use is further affected by their being traditional export commodities. Nigeria does not have a traditional base in fish farming and current efforts in aquaculture development in the country are confined to experimental fish farms operated by the government. Research in fish nutrition and fish diet development was recently started at the Institute for Oceanography and Marine Research where a laboratory-size pellet mill has recently been installed for the purpose.
The Philippines
Copra meal, maize, rice bran and fish meal are the most important feedstuffs in the Philippines and support a well developed poultry and livestock industry. The feed processing industry is well established and the development of artificial diets for large-scale intensive aquaculture can be initiated with existing expertise in fish nutrition and feed technology. The Philippines hosts the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department which conducts some research on fish nutrition and diet development.
Sri Lanka
Copra meal and rice bran are readily available for animal and fish feeding. Locally produced fish meal is available in limited quantities and is the primary protein supplement in feed for farm animals. Diets for carps consist primarily of copra meal and rice bran. Copra meal has been fed alone to carps at the Freshwater Fish Breeding and Experimental Station at Udawalawe with variable results. Plans are being made to improve this feeding regimen by formulating diets with other available ingredients. Despite an undeveloped feed processing industry there is potential for successful development of artificial diets for large-scale intensive fish culture in Sri Lanka.
Thailand
Thailand is perhaps the only developing country which has a net surplus of high quality feed commodities after domestic demands are met. Traditional fish diets are composed of trash fish, broken rice and rice bran. Other feedstuffs which are available and which can be used for artificial fish diet development include: maize, sorghum, cassava, fish meal, soybean meal, cottonseed meal, peanut cakes, copra cakes and distillery wastes. In view of the abundance of feedstuffs available, the prospects for intensive fish culture are very good in Thailand. The feed processing industry is highly developed and supports a large poultry and livestock industry. Although there is some commercial production of expanded catfish feed, feeding of this species is still predominantly traditional, i.e., mixing trash fish (and more recently, poultry offal) with rice bran and broadcasting the moist mixture into the pond. In recent years, this form of feeding is being suspected by fisheries experts
in the country as a possible cause of high mortality in some ponds. Affected fish showed symptoms similar to vitamin C (generally lacking in traditional diets) deficiency observed in catfish in the U.S.A. Work is under way at the National Inland Fisheries Institute at Bangkhen to determine if supplemental vitamin C in traditional diets will eliminate the problem. The Institute also has a programme to study factors affecting feed consumption in catfish; to develop flake feed for aquarium fish; and to determine the type and composition of feed suitable for fish fry and shrimp larvae.

4. CONCLUSIONS
The Training Course consisting of lectures, tutorials, class and laboratory practical work provided the knowledge essential for the initiation of fish nutrition work at both research and practical levels in feed programming and diet development. The field visits to government aquacultural research and commercial feed processing facilities provided exposure to the current state of the art in aquaculture techniques and modern production methods in feed ingredient and fish diet manufacture, respectively.
Tutorials intended to augment the lectures were helpful for those trainees who had weaker backgrounds in the basic sciences. Discussions of country problems planned for most afternoons focussed on subject matter presented in the morning lectures. Trainee participation in those discussions was restrained during the earlier sessions but picked up during the second week of the Course. Topics relating to fish health, nutrition and culture in each participating country were openly discussed. Highlights of these discussions were the individual presentations of his or her country's aquacultural development efforts, covering aspects of culture techniques and diet development.
From the presentations and discussions, the impression was that, to date, no concerted effort has been made to determine the nutritional adequacy of traditional fish diets in each of the ten countries represented. Successful development of artificial diets for use in countries that rely on traditional methods in aquaculture is contingent on the following:
(a) Thorough knowledge of traditional feeding methods;
(b) availability of reliable data on the composition of feed ingredients making up the traditional fish diets;
(c) appreciation of the importance of nutrition in achieving the productive potential in the cultured species; and
(d) availability of aquaculturists with sufficient background and training in fish nutrition and diet formulation to initiate fish diet development.
During the last week of the Course, UNDP's Fishery Advisor, Dr. Wm. Ellis Ripley, evaluated the Course. Each participant was asked to answer a questionnaire designed to evaluate the usefulness of the Training Course. All the trainees agreed that what was learned in the Course would enable them to formulate and initiate fish diet development programmes upon their return to their home stations.
The Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme intends to follow up this training by providing assistance for a feed development programme in selected countries. This would - include:
(a) Comprenhensive study, followed by evaluation, of traditional feeds and feeding practices;
(b) survey of all local feed ingredients suitable for fish feeding;
(c) compilation of nutrient data on all such feedstuffs;
(d) assessment by calculation or by chemical analysis of the traditional diets to determine their nutritional adequacy;
(e) development of balanced diets; and
(f) testing and evaluation of new balanced diets.
The objectives will be to develop new economic diets for large-scale fish culture and to improve traditional diets for smaller culture units, using locally available feed ingredients.
