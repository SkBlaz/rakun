<title>FAO's Normative Role - A Review for Members and Partners</title>
<section>1</section>
Introduction
One of the most vital challenges facing the world's leaders as the dawn of a new millennium approaches is the fight against hunger, malnutrition and the absence of food security in so many countries. At the 1996 World Food Summit in Rome, leaders of 186 countries pledged themselves to reduce by at least half the number of undernourished people in the world - currently more than 800 million - by 2015. To achieve this target and also to secure the increases in food production needed to feed a world population likely to grow by three billion in the coming three decades, one priority must be the development of new agricultural models. For more than half a century the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been providing its Member Nations with the normative and operational services they require to carry on the crucial fight against hunger and food insecurity.
The work that FAO carries out under its mandate falls broadly into six categories, five of which may be described as normative and are examined in this paper, and one, the provision of technical assistance, which is operational. The normative activities cover: setting up, maintaining and constantly updating databases of statistical information; providing a world centre of knowledge, information and expertise; providing a neutral forum for policy dialogue among nations and for the preparation of international agreements; developing international norms, standards and conventions; and disseminating information in support of Member Nations.
Gathering statistics
It would be hard to imagine a world without FAO's ubiquitous statistics. In a single month, November 1997, FAO's statistical database on the World Wide Web was accessed more than 2.1 million times, with more than nine million individual records downloaded. The need for a reliable source of statistics related to agriculture was recognized early this century. Growing intercontinental trade in food, the need to control plant- and animal-borne diseases, the prevention of famines and resulting socio-political calamities, all demanded a neutral body to collect statistics from all countries.
The pioneering work of David Lubin led to the foundation in 1905 of FAO's forerunner, the International Agricultural Institute, with 40 Member Nations. The Institute carried out the first World Agricultural Census in 1930, repeating the exercise ten years later. FAO took up the torch in 1950. Today, FAO's wealth of statistical data on agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development constitutes a vital resource for the Organization's 175 Member Nations.
Knowledge and expertise
FAO's staff include an internationally selected corps of technical experts and scientists whose skills, knowledge and experience are available to Member Nations, enabling them to benefit from lessons learned and concepts derived from more than 50 years of cumulative effort. It is the quality of this human resource that enables FAO to develop and disseminate new concepts, methodologies and models for agricultural development. The breadth and depth of the technical base mean that the Organization is uniquely placed to propose multidisciplinary, holistic solutions.
FAO also works to improve regional coordination, particularly in the management of shared resources. For example, through its programme for technical cooperation among developing countries, FAO identifies opportunities for countries to share expertise and technical resources.
A neutral forum
The key factor that makes all of FAO's normative activities universally acceptable is the Organization's ability to provide a neutral forum for discussions of policy and for preparing, negotiating and concluding international agreements. This neutrality also gives a unique value to FAO's many expert consultations, conferences, seminars, training sessions and similar activities; FAO has no national products to sell, no national or regional policies to defend, no ideological positions to foster.
This neutral environment is the only one in which so many conventions and standards relating to food and agriculture could have been agreed. The World Food Summit of November 1996 was so important because so many heads of state and government and senior policy-makers were able to come together at a neutral venue, assess the data on a global basis and agree on a plan of action that truly reflected a world consensus. A neutral forum is the sine qua non for international agreements and concerted cooperation; if FAO did not exist, it would be necessary to invent something very similar to secure the hundreds of international agreements covering food and agricultural matters today.
Norms, standards and conventions
Indeed, a considerable amount of FAO's activity involves the development of codes, norms and conventions. FAO's recognized position as a centre of excellence on a wide range of food and agricultural issues, coupled with its ability to marshal information and knowledge on a global basis, gives it a unique advantage in this area. Thus, for example, food processing around the world is shaped by the standards established in compliance with Codex Alimentarius and numerous important conventions negotiated by the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission and the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).
It is hard to imagine policy-makers reaching agreements on fishing or logging limits required to conserve stocks and ensure sustainability, without internationally established means such as those that FAO can provide to measure catches or volumes of extraction. Likewise, it would have been virtually impossible to succeed in coordinating national policies to control one of the world's oldest agricultural plagues, the desert locust. FAO's Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES) programme has provided the necessary normative framework and scientific foundation for policy-makers to achieve the level of international cooperation required to tackle the plague successfully.
Spreading the word
All this knowledge and information would be of limited value if it were not readily available to those who need it to make their policies and decisions. Thus, information dissemination is a key part of the normative role of FAO. The Organization is currently consolidating more than 40 separate databases under the umbrella of the World Agricultural Information Centre (WAICENT). The Centre is already providing clients -including governments, research institutes, universities and private users - with fast, economical access to the information they require, using a range of media: floppy disks, CD-ROMs and mainframe tapes as well as on-line access through the Internet, computer networks and telephone lines.

Collection and processing of statistical data
The need for reliable international agricultural statistics has continued to grow and, by providing advice and technical assistance, FAO cooperates with Member Nations in constantly improving the coverage, consistency and quality of data. Publications and other reference materials produced include:
· FAO Production Yearbook;
· FAO Trade Yearbook;
· FAO Quarterly Bulletin of Statistics;
· a soil and terrain (SOTER) and a soil profile (SDB) database;
· ECOCROP1, a database covering the soil and climate requirements of more than 1 700 useful plant species;
· the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS);
· the FAO/IAEA List of Mutant Varieties;
· the Seed Information System (SIS), which includes information on the performance of 80 000 varieties and assists in the identification of adapted varieties;
· a feed and forage database;
· FAO Fertilizer Yearbook;
· a database on fertilizer production, consumption and prices by country;
· national food balance sheets;
· nutrition country profiles;
· food composition tables;
· the Global Information and Early Warning System for Food and Agriculture (GIEWS), with databases on the current food situation and short-term outlook assessments for individual countries released electronically and through publications such as:
- Foodcrops and Shortages
- Food Supply Situation and Crop Prospects in Sub-Saharan Africa
- Special Reports and Alerts
- Special Commodity Statistical Bulletin.
FAO continues to be a recognized world centre for information related to fisheries and aquaculture. It provides an extensive range of information services to Member Nations through its 28 established databases. Some examples are:
· apparent fish consumption statistics based on food balance sheets;
· fishery and aquaculture production statistics;
· fishery commodity production and trade statistics;
· Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts (ASFA), an abstracting and indexing service covering the world's literature on the science, technology, management and conservation of aquatic resources and environments, including their socio-economic and legal aspects;
· GLOBEFISH, a service providing precise and unbiased information on international trade in fish and fishery products. It has associated regional information services for Asia and the Pacific (INFOFISH), Africa (INFOPECHE), Latin America and the Caribbean (INFOPESCA), Arab countries (INFOSAMAK), Eastern Europe (EASTFISH) and China (INFOYU).
The collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of comprehensive, qualitative and quantitative information on forests, forest products and forestry activities around the world are a priority for FAO. Examples of related information resources include:
· the Forest Resources Information System (FORIS) on global forest cover;
· FAO Forest Products Yearbook;
· Global Forest Resources Assessments;
· directories of forest research organizations, forestry education and training institutions and forestry extension organizations;
· FORGEN, a database on forest genetic resources;
· a database on national forest programmes.
In close cooperation with many international partners FAO also maintains databases and information resources on various aspects of sustainability and rural development. Examples are:
· AFRICOVER, which aims at creating a digital georeferenced thematic land cover database and maps for Africa;
· the FAO Digital World Atlas, an interactive digital atlas of the world for distribution via the Internet and on CD-ROM;
· land quality indicators, a collaborative study on indicator development involving FAO, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP);
· directories of agricultural education and training institutions;
· International Directory of Agricultural Extension Organizations;
· the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), in cooperation with UNEP, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU);
· Agenda 21 indicators;
· the Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring Sites (TEMS) database;
· GIS database maintenance, including operation and development of the ARTEMIS database (METEOSAT-NOAA data, rainfall estimates, vegetation indexes);
· agrometeorological crop monitoring and forecasting for food security.
Under Article XI of FAO's Constitution, the texts of Member Nations' laws and regulations affecting food and agriculture must be communicated to the Organization at the time of their publication. FAO's Legal Office maintains a computerized database of more than 6 000 records of laws, regulations and international agreements which are available for consultation by or on behalf of Member Nations and which also underpin its work in providing legislative assistance to Member Nations. This database is now on the Internet.

Centre of information and knowledge
Each year, as part of its regular programme of work and budget, FAO undertakes an analysis of selected food and agricultural issues as determined by its governing bodies and in response to requests by Member Nations. The Organization has been able to provide this normative service through its ability to draw on the best experience of national research centres and institutions belonging to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) as well as on research results from the leading universities of Member Nations.
Of FAO's many major analytical assessments in the field of agriculture, particular mention should be made of:
· The State of Food and Agriculture;
· World agriculture: towards 2010;
· Medium-term Prospects for Agricultural Commodities;
· the World Food Surveys;
· FAO Economic and Social Development Papers;
· Food, Nutrition and Agriculture;
· FAO Food and Nutrition Papers;
· Commodity Market Review;
· Impact of the Uruguay Round on agriculture;
· assessments of the world food situation, including Food Outlook.
Other important examples are:
· the universally recognized Digital soil map of the world and derived soil properties, on CD-ROM;
· a global inventory of successful indigenous or improved soil and water conservation practices in Africa, South and Southeast Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean;
· Current World Fertilizer Situation and Outlook a joint annual publication by FAO, the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO);
· a study of irrigation potential for Africa;
· the World Information and Early Warning System on Plant Genetic Resources;
· Seed Review, containing information on periodic assessments of member countries' plant-breeding and seed production and distribution sectors;
· Atlas of Desert Locust Breeding Habitats;
· a multidonor study on livestock and the environment;
· Nuclear techniques in soil-plant studies for sustainable agriculture and environment protection.
Flagship products on the status of aquatic resources and various aspects of fisheries and aquaculture include:
· The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA), a biennial review of recent developments, major issues and prospects for world fisheries and aquaculture production, utilization and trade;
· the Fisheries Digital Interactive Atlas;
· detailed reviews of the state of world fishery resources for marine and inland fisheries and aquaculture.
FAO is a major source of analysis of the world's forest resources and the forestry sector. Two broad types of information are available: global or regional analytical studies/assessments; and states of art on practices and methodologies. Examples of publications include:
· State of the World's Forests, a biennial review of. the world forestry situation containing statistical data interpreted in a policy-relevant form;
· Global Forest Resources Assessments, which are issued every ten years and highlight forest cover, deforestation and forest degradation;
· forestry outlook studies, which elaborate forestry sector analyses from statistics on wood products, trade, fibre supply and production capacities, with strategic regional and global projections;
· Unasylva, a professional forestry quarterly;
· technical newsletters issued regularly on non-wood forest products, forest genetic resources, forest harvesting, community forestry, etc.
In addition, a series of specific initiatives have been directed to the design of innovative concepts and methodologies for the promotion of sustainable agricultural and rural development and coordination of the follow-up to UNCED Agenda 21 and related conventions and conferences. Examples of activities and outputs are:
· Socio-Economic and Gender Analysis (SEAGA): a joint activity of FAO, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNDP. SEAGA is now being tested and applied in more than 20 countries worldwide;
· K2, software that allows users to test environmental, social and economic indicators against a set of critical threshold values;
· ECOZONE 2, software that FAO is upgrading so it can be used for full-scale environmental impact assessment, training and planning in agricultural development projects;
· rural land market studies, which have contributed to the recent formation of the Negotiated Land Reform Network (NELAREN), linking FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Bank;
· comparative analyses and studies on decentralization policies and programmes, based on a joint effort between FAO, the World Bank, IFAD, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and various bilateral agencies;
· Strategic Extension Campaign - a participatory-oriented method of agricultural extension, describing the methodology elaborated to achieve extension cost effectiveness in a relatively short period;
· agrometeorological monitoring, including development of software for remote sensing application and standardization of formats in, for example, yield forecasting methodologies.
FAO produces a series of legislative studies designed to disseminate legal information in the most appropriately usable form and to analyse recent trends in national legislation for the information of national lawmakers. Subjects covered by recent publications include:
· international watercourses agreements;
· pesticides registration legislation;
· evaluation of impacts on the environment in support of sustainable development;
· legislation governing food control and quality certification;
· coastal state requirements for foreign fishing;
· African customary water law;
· food security;
· integrated coastal area management;
· aquaculture and inland fisheries legislation.

Forum for policy dialogue and for the preparation, negotiation and conclusion of international agreements
International acceptance of FAO's normative work is a result of the Organization's ability to provide a truly neutral forum for policy dialogue and the preparation, negotiation and conclusion of international agreements. FAO's role in providing such a forum for policy discussion and technical dialogue is demonstrated in the work of many of its committees. One example is the Committee on Commodity Problems (CCP), another is the Intergovernmental Commodity Groups. The preparation of the Rome Declaration and World Food Summit Plan of Action by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) also illustrates this role. Other FAO committees address a wide range of normative issues such as: food standards; nutritional requirements; the monitoring of food insecurity and vulnerability; the implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action; national commodity policies; technical issues concerning international trade, such as biotechnology and environmental regulation; and programme
development, such as nutrition education and consumer protection.
In the field of agriculture, every two years FAO convenes the Committee on Agriculture (COAG). The Organization provides the secretariats for the:
· Committee on World Food Security;
· Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture;
· Commission on Fertilizers (which is likely to be renamed the Commission on Fertilizers and Plant Nutrition);
· International Rice Commission;
· Asia and Pacific Plant Protection Commission;
· European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease;
· International Task Force on Hybrid Rice (in collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute).
FAO convenes the only specialized global forum on fisheries, the Committee on Fisheries (COFI), to discuss key issues and formulate global policy. In addition there are nine FAO regional fisheries bodies:
· Asia-Pacific Fishery Commission (APFIC);
· General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean (GFCM);
· European Inland Fisheries Advisory Commission (EIFAC);
· Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF);
· Indian Ocean Fishery Commission (IOFC);
· Committee for Inland Fisheries of Africa (CIFA);
· Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC);
· Commission for Inland Fisheries of Latin America (COPESCAL);
· Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC).
Serving as a neutral forum for policy and technical dialogue on forests and forestry is a major role for FAO. Examples at the global and regional levels are the:
· Committee on Forestry (COFO), which brings together senior forest officials every two years to identify emerging issues, seek solutions to common problems and advise FAO;
· Ministerial Meeting on Forestry, first convened in 1995 to offer the highest-level input available to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) - future meetings can be convened as needed to address key issues;
· technical bodies, i.e. statutory bodies on paper and wood products, forest gene resources and poplars and various ad hoc fora that address priority technical issues and advise FAO;
· six Regional Forestry Commissions, of which there is one each for Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Near East and North America and which are convened biennially to consider emerging regional issues, seek solutions and advise FAO.
Much work is complementary to that of other international organizations with which FAO also cooperates, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC). FAO provides the secretariats for the:
· CCP and its system of Intergovernmental Commodity Groups and the Consultative Sub-Committee on Surplus Disposal;
· Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission;
· Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Nutrient Requirements.
FAO provides the secretariat for the Technical Advisory Committee of CGIAR and also serves as the focal point for the Network on Rural Development and Food Security, which has been newly established under the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC) to act as one of the principal mechanisms for coordinating follow-up to the World Food Summit by the UN system.
Global and regional networks are becoming an increasingly important vehicle for disseminating technologies, building capacity and exchanging experience. Examples of such networks in which FAO is closely involved include:
· the Global Network on Integrated Soil Management for Sustainable Use of Salt Affected Soils;
· the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies;
· the Network on Conservation Tillage in Latin America (RELACO);
· regional networks for vegetable research and development in Africa;
· the Network on Identification, Conservation and Use of Wild Plants in the Mediterranean Region (MEDUSA);
· the Information Network on Post-Harvest Operations (INPHO), incorporating coordinated inputs from institutions worldwide;
· regional networks on food marketing in Africa, Asia, the Near East and Latin America;
· regional networks on rural finance in the Near East, Africa and Asia.

Norms, standards and conventions
The development of codes, norms and conventions is a crucial part of FAO's work. The Organization has unique advantages in this area by virtue of its position as a centre of excellence on a wide range of food and agricultural issues, together with its ability to marshal information and knowledge on a global basis. The Codex Alimentarius and the work of the joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, which promotes the harmonization of national food regulations to protect consumers and facilitate trade, have been of great importance. Likewise the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) provides independent scientific advice to establish internationally accepted standards for food quality and safety.
Another important example of FAO's activity is its administration of the Principles of Surplus Disposal through the Consultative Sub-Committee on Surplus Disposal. These sets of norms play an essential role in the implementation of various agreements reached as a result of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. FAO's initiative and involvement at the international level have resulted in a number of intergovernmental agreements, such as the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources and the World Soil Charter. The Organization also works to improve regional coordination, particularly in the management of shared resources - supporting, for example, the Treaty for Amazonian Cooperation.
FAO is involved in activities and bodies and in producing publications related to norms, standards and conventions, for example:
· Codex Alimentarius (various volumes);
· Principles of surplus disposal and consultative obligations of Member Nations (a handbook);
· Concepts and definitions used in international collections of food and agriculture statistics (issued by FAO/UN, the Economic Commission for Europe/Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and EUROSTAT);
· Revision of the International Plant Protection Convention;
· International standards for phytosanitary measures: harmonization of national plant quarantine procedures and regulations;
· technical guidelines for the safe movement of germplasm, produced in cooperation with the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (17 completed, five in preparation);
· the UNEP/FAO Intergovernmental Negotiation Committee, which produces the Report on the Progress of Negotiations for an international legally binding instrument for the application of the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade;
· the Code of Conduct for the Import and Release of Exotic Biological Control Agents;
· formulation of official FAO standards for pesticide application equipment;
· World Reference Base for Soil Resources;
· standard operating procedures for the quality control testing of animal disease vaccines such as CBPP and rinderpest.
FAO has played a major role in establishing and promoting the implementation of:
· the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries;
· the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas;
· the Rome Consensus on World Fisheries;
· the Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security;
· norms and standards for statistics through the Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics.
FAO has had an influential voice in international fora and deliberations on many critical environmental and sustainability issues that have led to conventions and agreements, and its Legal Office works in a multidisciplinary manner with the technical departments in facilitating negotiations on agreements and instruments both of a legally and non-legally binding nature. FAO is involved in numerous bodies concerning such agreements as well as in follow-up activities, including:
· the UN Commission on Sustainable Development;
· the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests;
· implementation of the International Convention to Combat Desertification and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity;
· the FAO Model Code of Forest Harvesting Practices;
· establishment of harmonized methodologies for land cover classification and legending for the analysis of land use changes;
· establishment of norms for mapping (geometry, projection systems, topography);
· Development of the AFRICOVER programme and the Regional Environmental Information Management Project (REIMP);
· water resources of the Nile basin;
· the Lake Victoria Environmental Information Management Programme.

Diffusion of information
WAICENT is a corporate database made up of two linked data systems:
FAOSTAT, which contains statistical information, and FAOINFO, which contains textual information.
FAOSTAT contains a constantly updated collection of time series data on demography, agriculture, fisheries and forestry from 210 countries and territories as well as data on trade flows, food aid, development assistance and the results of the World Agricultural Census and household budget and food consumption surveys.
As FAOINFO becomes fully operational, the text retrieval system will cover a wide range of information on food and agriculture, including:
· monthly reports on global food production;
· a comprehensive collection of internationally accepted food standards;
· updates on the distribution of plant pests worldwide;
· country-level nutrition, fisheries and forestry profiles;
· maximum residue limits for pesticides in food;
· bio-economic modelling systems for shrimp fisheries;
· analyses of scientific fishing data and farm surveys.
It also includes a digitized soil map of the world, at a scale of 1:5 000 000 and with country boundaries updated to June 1992, illustrating the results of decades of study on the soil situation of each country.

Interdependence of normative and operational activities
To a great extent, it is artificial to examine FAO's normative role in isolation from its operational activities. The two sets of activities are not only largely interdependent but they are also mutually reinforcing: the quality of FAO's activities in the field is ensured by the constant nourishment derived from the Organization's normative resources. Likewise, FAO's normative work is constantly reinforced by lessons learned in the field. Indeed, it is this combination of normative and operational activities as well as the capacity to span the consequent divide in many of its programmes that give FAO its comparative advantages and explain the unique "value added" that it is able to provide Member Nations.

Conclusion
As this century draws to a close and the world looks forward to the new millennium, a reformed and streamlined FAO stands ready to work with all Member Nations in their efforts to achieve food security for their peoples, a goal to which they pledged themselves at the World Food Summit. The great wealth of knowledge, experience and expertise that FAO has accumulated in more than half a century since its foundation, part of which has been referred to in this paper, constitutes a major resource on which governments can draw in their fight against hunger and malnutrition. FAO is determined to provide all the support possible to help them win the battle.
