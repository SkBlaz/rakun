INTRODUCTION Country Profile.
1.1.1. Geographical Location, Demography and Economy Eritrea is located in the northeastern part of Africa and covers an area of 124,320 km2. It is bounded by the Sudan in the west and north west, Ethiopia in the south, Djibouti in the southeast, and the Red Sea in the east (FAO/ Sectoral review, 1994). Administratively, Eritrea is divided into six zones (zoba) namely: Makel, Debub, Gash-Barka, Anseba, Semenawi Keih Bahri, and Debubawi Keih Bahri. The population of Eritrea is about 3.5 million out of whom 80% live in rural areas and derive their livelihood from agriculture. There are nine linguistic groups namely: Afar, Bilen, Tigre, Saho, Tigrigna, Kunama, Nara, Hidareb, and Rashaida (MOA, 1993). Due to the prolonged liberation war, the economy of the country progressively declined during those years. Between 1985 and 1990, real gross domestic production (GDP) declined by 0.7% per annum, but after independence it is increasing rapidly (E.g. in 1997 an increase of 8% was reported). Agriculture is the main economic sector, both as a source of food and raw material for industry. In 1994, crop production, livestock, forestry, and fishery contributed about one-third of the gross domestic production (FAO, 1996).
Bio-Physical Environment ! Topography.
Eritrea is a country of great topographical diversity. Through millennia, erosion, tectonic movements and subsidence have occurred and continue to occur accentuating the unevenness of the surface. Highland areas stretch between the eastern and western lowland plains. Altitudes range from the highest peak of Mount Soira, 3018 metres above sea level, down to the Denkel Depression, about 100 metres below sea level (MOA, 1994). ! Agro-Ecological Zones.
According to FAO (1994), Eritrea is divided into six agro-ecological zones. These are: the Central Highland Zone (CHZ), situated at altitudes over 1,500 m with over 500 mm of rainfall; the Western Escarpment Zone (WEZ), situated at altitudes between 750 and 1,500 m with annual rainfall between 400 and 600 mm; the South Western Lowland Zone (SWLZ), situated at altitudes between 600 and 750 m, with annual rainfall between 500 and 700 mm; the Green Belt Zone (GBZ), located between 750 to over 2000 m, with rainfall from 700 to more than 1000 mm; the Coastal Plains Zone (CPL), from below sea level to 600 m, with less than 200 mm rainfall; and the north-western Lowland Zone(NWLZ), with an altitude from 400 to 1,500 m, and up to 300 mm of rainfall.
4 ! Climate.
Due to its geographical setting, Eritrea has diverse climates ranging from hot arid, adjacent to the Red Sea to temperate sub-humid in isolated micro-catchments within the eastern escarpment of the Highlands. About 72% of Eritrea is classified as very hot, with mean annual temperature exceeding 24o C, while not more than 14% is classified as mild or cool with mean annual temperature below 21.5o C (FAO, 1996). Most parts of the country receive rainfall from the southwest Monsoon, from April to September. Some rain falls in April/May while the main rain starts in June, with the heaviest precipitation in July and August. Only the coastal plains and the central part of the eastern escarpment of the central highland have winter rainfall, November through March, that is borne by north and south-east continental air streams that carry little moisture until affected by the Red Sea. The total annual rainfall tends to increase from north to south, from less than 200 mm at the northern border with Sudan to more than 700 mm in the south-western part of the country. The Green Belt Zone, receives the highest annual rainfall averaging about 900 mm (FAO, 1994). ! Soils.
The soils of Eritrea are complex. In the northern and southern sections of the Red Sea coastal plains, they are predominantly sandy desert soils. In other part of the plains, ortho-solonchaks, regosols, and andosols are to be found. In the Highlands, the predominant soils are chromic, eutric, and calsic cambisols of strong red colour. Other soils found in the Highlands are lithosols, xerosols and fluvisols. Soils in the western plains include vertisols and fluvisols (FAO, 1996).
Significance of the Study.
About a century ago, almost one third of Eritrea's territory was covered with natural forest and extra vast area of acacia woodland. Now the country is left with less than 1% natural forest and very few million hectares of degraded acacia and scrublands (Table 1). As the forests were deteriorated, tremendous important habitat of the wild life was dwindled and so for the degradation of land fertility due to high rate of soil erosion. The main reason for the aggravation of the process were intensive logging for timber, charcoal making, agricultural expansion, poles and post for traditional house `Hidmo' and fire wood and generally unwise land use policy of the successive colonial Governments. Fuelwood is one of the serious detrimental demands on ecology. It is the major source of household energy in the country. Nearly every household in the urban centres and all the rural areas of Eritrea, depend on wood as their main source of energy. It is very evident then many more trees have to be cut down on a continued basis from the limited resource to meet the relentless demand of fuelwood by the population. A government legislation banning the cutting of live trees is in effect since 1994, but the compelling demand for this energy source makes it hard to hold as people who are left with virtually no energy alternative in their hands will be forced to continue cutting. The biggest share, for cause of forest distraction, lies with tree cutting for the purpose of fuelwood. This is followed by timber cutting for use of construction poles.
This paper reviews the existing studies related to fuelwood and/or charcoal in the country during the last five years at national or regional level, and analyses the past, present and possible future trends of these products in the context of local consumption.
2.1. FOREST RESOURCES Natural Forest Resources.
Three major forest/woodland types are distinguished in Eritrea: highland forests, Acacia woodlands and riverine forests. Originally the highland forests of Juniperus procera and Olea africana would have extended over much of the plateaux, but have been largely destroyed or degraded; only remnants now survive. On the lowlands and lower escarpments, Acacia woodlands occupy about a quarter of the surface of the country. Riverine forests fringe river systems of the Gash/ Mereb, Setit and Barka in the Lowlands, where Doum palm is an important constituent. These forests are under the greatest threat as they occupy fertile, well-watered and level sites ­ suited to development for commercial agriculture. However, they are also vital to the lives of the local population. On the coastal plains tree cover becomes increasingly sparse towards the sea. In places mangroves border the coast, the main species being Avicennia marina. Natural forest cover has been classified according to six major vegetation types following international methodology.
Highland forest, composed of a mixture of coniferous species (Juniper) and broad- leafed species (African olive and associated species).
Mixed woodlands of Acacia and associated species, occurring mainly in the southern part of the western lowlands, but also in restricted areas elsewhere in the country;.
Bush or shrub vegetation, which is the dominant cover in Eritrea;.
Grasslands and wooded grasslands, which occur in many parts of the country;.
Riverine forest, composed essentially of Doum palm, which is common in the Western Lowlands and is frequent in the Eastern Lowlands; and.
Mangrove occurring in many places along the coast and concentrated mainly around Assab and between Tio and Massawa. The natural vegetation of the country constitutes 0.8% highland forest. Forest and woodlands, including riverine forest and mangroves cover 13.5% of the total area. The category "bush" is the dominant vegetation in Eritrea covering 63% of the total area. The riverine forests and mangroves play important ecological and economic roles for rural communities, and occupy 1.5% and less than 0.1%, respectively. (Source: Interpretation of Landsat TM by FAO project TCP/ERI/12 (July, 1997)). The most recent national vegetation cover data is presented in Table.

In the above table, it shows that Eritrea has an important vegetation cover composed of woodlands riverine forests and mangroves, in addition to the Juniper-Olea forest. The total area of these formations constitutes 13.7 % of the total landmass of the country.
Planted Forest Resources.
Prior to liberation (before 1991), though few accurate records were maintained, tree planting was concentrated within 6 major catchments (namely, Anseba, Nefhi, Damas, Mereb, Ferendayt and Leghede) as part of a soil and water conservation strategy, based on Food- for-Work. In this way over 10,000 ha of plantation were planted, mainly consisting of Eucalyptus cladocalyx, but also E. globulus,.
7 E.camaldulensis, Acacia saligna, A.decurrens, A. mearnsii, etc. Such work was nearly always combined with physical terracing operations. Due to the lack of subsequent maintenance, few of these plantations remain. In the years leading up to liberation, tree planting by farmers appears rarely to have taken place. Tree planting for amenity by municipalities has obviously taken place in the past, to good effect, but due to the uncertainties prevailing over latter years, existing trees have been damaged, or have died, and there has been little management or replacement. This tree planting was based on approximately 31 nurseries, located principally within territory held by the Ethiopian Government. Following liberation (1991 - 1998) about 69.9 million seedlings have been planted and 147,580 ha of an area closed for natural regeneration. Details of major activities are tabulated below: Table 2: Achievements of Afforestation Programme (1991 ­ 1998) No 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Activity Hillside terrace con. Check dam con.

The survival rate of the planted seedlings, is about 30 - 40% in the Lowlands and 60 - 70% in the Highlands. Since Liberation, there has been an upsurge of interest on tree planting by individuals, communities and organisations with large numbers of seedlings collected from nurseries, free of charge. Since 1994, the Eritrean students have been participating in afforestation and soil conservation campaign during summer vacation, in the whole country, which is organised by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture. Since then, about 19,000 students have participated every year and planted about 5.8 million tree seedlings. The main afforestation programme is directed at soil and water conservation and fuelwood production. There has been a major and commendable commitment by the Eritrean Government to continue a programme that evolved under the Ethiopian regime as an instrument of international food assistance. The old model of Food For Work (FFW) or Cash For Work (CFW) was successful to the extent that it engaged.
8 community participation in the short term. But, it has no mechanism to engage them beyond that because they are unable to identify with the objectives and outputs, hence the government is assessing the cost-effectiveness of continued investment along this lines.
TIMBER AND POLE PRODUCTION.
Eritrea's timber heritage was expropriated by the Italians. During the Italian colonial era, logging in Eritrea was intensively carried out. Up to 1947, 55 sawmills and small wood processing firms were established in the country. (Aldo, 1947, cited in MOA, 1994). The major tree species exploited by the logging companies were Juniperus procera, Olea africana, Hyphaene thebaica, Balanites aegyptiaca, and Acacia albida/Faidherbia albida/. Sawlogs were transported by trucks and, in areas where access was difficult, cable was used (Ramanatan, 1978, cited in MOA, 1994). At this time, except about four old sawmills, which are most of the time idle in Asmara, all other sawmills were either non-existent or closed due to a lack of sawlogs (personal observation). A typical home in the highlands (the Hidmo) will take about one hundred poles to be constructed, a staggering number which is equivalent to felling of one hundred live trees. Currently in Eritrea, it can be said that there is virtually no timber trees left for construction, all timber is imported. It is estimated that around 60,000 cubic metres of sawn timber and semi-finished wood is imported annually. The landed value of timber is currently around $ 332 per cubic metre. (FAO 1997). Transmission poles and scaffolding are also imported. Matches are produced in Asmara from imported splints. Undoubtedly Eritrea has an expanding need for construction grade softwood timber, spurred by an expanding population and expectations of rapid development.
4.1. FUELWOOD CONSUMPTION AND SUPPLY Fuelwood consumption.
There are very few studies conducted on to the availability and consumption of fuelwood and/or charcoal both at national or regional level.
Studies Conducted at National level.
9 A. Study Conducted by the Department of Energy Where fuelwood consumption is concerned, the Department of Energy in cooperation with Lahmeyer International (a company from Germany) has carried out a project "Strengthening the Department of Energy (DOE)" during February 1996March 1997. The main objectives of the project were: ! Strengthening the management capacity and development of the personnel in the DoE in areas of energy policies, planning, analysis, system modelling for energy and the environment, this includes in particular the initiation and establishment of a data base. Formulation of recommendations aiming at improvement of energy efficiency and Implementation of energy saving measures in the various economic sectors. Development of energy standards and regulations in the electric utility, oil refining and distribution system and in the field of renewable energies.
16 different studies have been done, among which the household energy survey and the national energy balance have more relevance in regard to fuelwood consumption. Household Energy Survey The objective of the household energy survey is to conduct or guide an undertaking of a household energy survey of demand and supply and compile in a usable form. Beside this, recommendations concerning the following aspects should be provided: ! the environmental impact of the harvesting of forest resources, animal dung and agricultural residues, ! the foreign currency impact of fuel-switching, ! organisational issues in the manufacturing and marketing of improved cooking stoves and ! renewable energy projects including village electrification. In addition to this, the study team goes somewhat beyond the ToR in two aspects: ! Some preliminary findings are set out based upon an initial analysis of the results, and ! it recommends directions given for further in-depth analysis. In the absence of reliable national population figures, a range of levels of household energy consumption are presented, and an illustrative example is presented giving estimated area and national energy consumption levels for a specimen set of population figures. The field survey was carried out with national coverage according to a stratified design which sampled rural, small urban, medium urban and large urban (where applicable) in 11 Household Energy Areas (HEA, see Table 3) which defined for the purpose of the study in order to stratify the samples in homogeneous household energy-consuming zones. 2,065 households were interviewed in all the region of Eritrea.

Data collected covered the following: ! Type and source of all fuels ! Distance and time taken for fuel collection (present and past) ! Price of fuels consumed ! Frequency of fuel collection ! Amount of fuelwood, charcoal, agri-residue, animal dung and kerosene normally consumed, and extent of use of each for cooking, beverages, etc.

According to this study, 78% of the total national energy consumption is consumed at household level and 59% of the total final national energy consumption is from woodfuel. According to the household energy survey, 69.4% of the total household energy consumption is from fuelwood and 10.7% from charcoal (table 4). Table 4: Total Household Energy Consumption: Using a Specimen 1996 Population Estimate of 2.9 million Fuel Fuelwood Charcoal Animal Dung Agri-Residue Kerosene LPG Electricity Total Key Findings Household size varies geographically, from a mean of 4.23 in Maereba (SE Debub) to 7.34 in Barentu (SW Lowlands). The average household size for the total (unweighted) national sample is 5.52, with 95% confidence limits of ± 0.125. Fuelwood is consumed by 88% of the households sampled, mainly for cooking. Per capita consumption of fuelwood varies from an average of 116 kg/y in Zoba Maekel Rural to 965 kg/y in Coastal Rural. When fuelwood is not readily available in the rural areas, the substitute is generally animal dung or agricultural residues. The price of fuelwood ranges from 140 to 800 Nakfa/T, the higher end of the price range applying to Asmara. The (round-trip) distance travelled by household members to obtain fuelwood has risen significantly in many areas over the last 30 years to between 10 and 20 km, although the emergence since independence of traders selling fuelwood door-to-door has effectively eliminated this journey in several areas, particularly in small urban centres.

12 The pattern of charcoal consumption in Eritrea is a complex one. In the lowlands, some households report buying it locally. In other areas, most of the charcoal consumed is taken in the form of partially burned fuelwood from the injera cooker. The unweighted mean consumption per capita of charcoal by the households interviewed is 42 kg/cap/y. Of this, between 10 and 14.5 kg/cap/y is obtained commercially. Charcoal ranges in price from 390 to 2,800 Nakfa/T, with an unweighted mean price of 1,400 Nakfa/T. Animal dung is used principally not as a preferred fuel but as a substitute for fuelwood in areas where fuelwood is not easily available. Most of it is obtained locally and individually. It is not yet common for animal dung to be marketed commercially. The unweighted mean consumption rate of the household interviewed is 111 kg/cap/y. The consumption of agricultural residues as a household fuel is not as widespread in Eritrea as other biomass fuels. As in the case of animal dung, the majority of the consumption takes place in the fuelwood-scarce parts of Debub. The unweighted mean consumption rate of the households interviewed is 13 kg/cap/y. National Energy Consumption Levels In order to illustrate the type of aggregation that will be possible to carry out for the estimate of national household energy consumption when the forthcoming population census has been conducted, energy intensities for each fuel consumed, and for each HEA, have been combined with an estimated population estimate of 2.9 million to provide illustrative figures for regional and national household energy consumption and possible scale of consumption of forest resources. The following Table sets out estimated consumption of biomass fuels by households given a hypothetical 1996 population of around 2.9 million Table 5: Estimated Consumption of Biomass Fuels by Households given a Hypothetical (1996 Population of around 2.9 Million) Biomass Fuel Fuelwood Charcoal Animal Dung Agri-Residue Consumption Rate (weighted) 440 kg/cap/ann 39 kg/cap/ann 126 kg/cap/ann 16 kg/cap/ann Annual Consumption (Million MT) 1.29 0.114 0.37 0.047.
These volumes refer to energy consumption. The supply of these fuels is more complicated, as much of the fuelwood reported above is re-used in the form of charcoal taken from injera cookers and from the brewing of drinks such as suwa (some of which is sold to informal sector and small-scale enterprises, which are not included in the survey). Thus, despite the figure of 114,000 T/y of charcoal consumed, the ban on charcoal has been quite successful. According to the household energy survey, it is estimated that only between 15,000 and 21,000 T/y of the total of 114,000 T/y are bought from markets or shops, and a substantial amount of this originates from "recycled" fuelwood. Much of the balance of between 93,000 and.
13 99,000 T/y is also derived from recycling fuelwood already shown in the above table. However, the actual proportion of charcoal that originates in this way is unknown. Nonetheless an estimate may be made that if between 30 and 60% of households cooking injera adopt the practice of "recycling" fuelwood for their own or other use, then the total quantity of charcoal so produced (including from suwa brewing) would be between 42,500 and 82,500 T/y. This would mean that the fuelwood used for kilnproduced charcoal could be between 195,300 and 443,300 T/y. This possible estimate charcoal tonnage range from partially burned domestic fuelwood is based on tentative estimates of the prevalence of this "recycling" practice and a charcoal conversion ratio in injera cooker of 8:1.

Based on the above study, the national woodfuel (both fuelwood and charcoal) consumption level is estimated at 1.48 million tonnes per annum, most of which comprised firewood (90.5%). This figure (1.48 million tonnes) is obtained from the table figure of 1.45 million tonnes on the assumption that all the charcoal consumed on national scale as not carbonised charcoal (i.e., kiln charcoal), rather a substantial amount of this quantity comes from the recycling process of fuelwood at the hearth. Thus, out of the total charcoal consumption, estimated at 117,419 tonnes, only 20% is considered to be kiln produced, i.e., 23,484 tonnes, and a kiln conversion efficiency of 30% is assumed (i.e., 6:1 ratio). B. Study Conducted by FAO/ MOA There was a Socio-economic study conducted by the FAO-TCP with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in 1997. The general objective of the study is to improve the level of available data regarding socio-economic interactions with forest and wildlife in specific selected interventions. These include: ! Inventory of surrounding villages of existing permanent closures and assessment of encroachment on these closures ! Inventory of surrounding villages of proposed potential closures and existing actual use and claims on these areas.
14 ! ! ! ! Inventory of surrounding villages of the proposed potential forest plantation and existing use and claims on the area. Inventory of village(s) to which temporary closure belong and assessment of fodder availability and existing pressure on the closure. Inventory of village(s) in and near to the proposed potential game reserves and assessment of actual encroachment by concessions and logging; Assessment of actual use of the area and threat or damage by wildlife.
Data is collected from twenty-six sample villages located in different Zobas and SubZobas. Means of collecting data, was mainly from a group discussion in a substructured interview and from officials for some technical questions. Parameters used to collect the required data include: ! geographical and demographic parameters ! Socio-economic parameters Parameters which would help assessing forestry and wildlife aspects out of the twenty-six sample villages: ! twenty six discussions on village inventories ! thirteen on existing permanent closures ! five on potential forest plantations ! five on temporary closures ! fourteen on potential game reserve ! and three on existence of wildlife in some study sites The output of this study in regard to fuelwood consumption is stated shortly as follows: Fuelwood consumption for cooking purposes is very high in the Eritrean cities, towns and countrysides. In big towns, where electric power is available, few households use electric power and liquid propane gas (LPG) as an alternative for fuelwood, specially for baking Ingera (traditional leafy bread), which requires the highest energy consumption rate in a household. Kerosene is slowly being introduced in the countryside for cooking. Dung and agricultural residue, though they can not replace fuelwood (because of their poor energy output), could be mentioned as an energy alternative in households with livestock and cultivation areas, especially with maize field-aftermath. The following table indicates the estimated consumption rate of fuelwood / five headed household and other alternatives of energy sources used for cooking.

18 The fuelwood consumption differs greatly from place to place, depending on the availability and price. Remote villages which have a better access to forests with adequate deadwood of trees and bushes use to consume more than villages located near big towns where they have no or little access to forests and they are forced to buy with higher prices. In addition for cooking, there are also villages where fuelwood is also used for light purposes. Such villages let fuelwood burning for the whole night to avoid darkness. Having this in mind, one could imagine how far the wood consumption would differ from place to place and from household to household. The highest monthly fuelwood consumption in a household with five heads was given to be 700 kg, with no other additional source of energy.
