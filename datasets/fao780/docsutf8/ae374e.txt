Agribusiness Handbooks.
Barley / Malt / Beer.
This publication was prepared by the FAO Investment Centre under the FAO/EBRD cooperation agreement to provide quick technical and economical reference material to EBRD's agribusiness team in sub-sectors where they often work. Focus was given to the Bank's countries of operation in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, with indicators of technical and economical performance in other regions of the world noted for comparison. The series of handbooks contained in this publication cover specific agribusiness sub-sectors, with information on production and processing techniques, costs and margins, world production, prices and trade trends. Data were collected from a number of official and unofficial sources as indicative information that should be interpreted with caution, and do not imply the expression of any opinion by FAO concerning the economic situation of countries mentioned. (October 1999).
FAO / EBRD Agribusiness Handbooks vol.1 - Barley / Malt / Beer.
In Mesopotamia, clay bars more than 5 000 years old have been found, explaining brewing process of the time. «Beer's bread» was made out of germinated barley seeds. Brewers prepared SIKARU by crumbling beer's bread into water. After boiling and addition of a few herbs, Sumerians brewers obtained a bacteriologicaly safe drink. Time after time, the starch used for the brewing process has been originated from maize (Amerindian), soya (Hindoo and Persian), millet and sorghum (African), rice (Far East), but nowadays beer production from barley's malt is the most common worldwide.
1- BARLEY CULTIVATION.
Key production parameters.
· Two main types of barley: winter (2 or 6 rows) and spring (2 rows) sorts. Advantage of winter sorts is that the grain is mature earlier, which ensures the brewers with a continuing supplying at a time when they become partially out of stocks from the past year. The main risk factors for winter sorts are ears' freezing during growing period and overwarming during maturation. Temperate climate is ideal for barley. Barley adapts to a wide variety of soils, and is for example less sensible than wheat to dryness or poor land. Planting after wheat is particularly convenient. Planting period runs from mid October until mid December for winter sorts, while spring sorts are generally planted in March - April. Density of grain sown varies from 200 to 350 / m², depending on the density objective for the crop. The growing season depends a lots of the variety. Winter sorts complete their development cycle with a cumulative temperature over zero between 1900 and 2000°C, while spring sorts need only 1500 - 1700°C. Harvesting from mid July to mid August for winter barley and during the three last weeks of August for spring varieties. According to FAO Statistics, world-wide yields averaged 2355 kg/ha in 1996. However, depending on climatic, variety and cultivation conditions, specifics yields can vary as much as between 800 and 7500 kg/ha; irrigation in particular contributes to increased output.

Collectively the EU is the largest producing area. Russian, once the world's largest producer, had seen a steady drop in production from 27 million tonnes in 1992 to 15,9 million in 1997. In FSU and Eastern Europe, the best growing areas are Poland, Czech Rep., Romania, Baltic States, Ukraine, Western Russia.
Key production costs.
For an average yield of 5,3 ton/ha obtained in UK in good cropping condition with availability of all necessary good quality inputs, the variable costs per ha are roughly as follows:.

In September 1998, global barley prices dropped to their lowest level in over four years, with French barley falling to US$ 115/tonne Fob. Malting barley prices assumes a premium over feed of around 10-20%. US farmer's barley prices US$ 2,25 - 2,65 per bushel in 1997/98 US$ 2,75 per bushel in 1996/97.
Average margins for producers.
Average margins for producers highly depend on the level of subsidies for sunflower cropping. In the EU for example, the subsidies amount up to US$ 80/tonne. At a grain sale's price of US$ 130 per ton and a yield of 5,3 ton / ha, the general output is (130 + 80) x 5,3 i.e. US$ 1 110 / ha. Gross margin for production of barley is 1 110 - 710 = US$ 400 / ha In the calculation of producers' margins, straw should not be forgotten, as it is an important valuable by-product of major cereal cultivation. Average yield is approximately 2,75 tonnes per ha, value US$ 20 to 80 per tonne according to region and season. It contributes to increase producers' gross margin by US$ 100 per ha cultivated in average.

· Increasing concern world wide in the food industry today over both the pesticide residues in raw materials and their effect on the process and quality of end products. In the malting and brewing industry, the ability of residues on malting barley to affect both process performance and quality of malt and beer have been demonstrated. To guarantee final product quality, official evaluations of chemical residues are being introduced in several countries. Accordingly it allows the unique use of those pesticides with no undesirable effect. 13% of barley produced world-wide is processed into malt (20 million tons on a total average production of 160 million tons). The main use of barley is fodder for livestock. To be used in the malting / brewing industry, barley must fulfil the following criteria: - high germination capacity - purity in the variety - graded grain - low protein content.
2- PROCESSING INTO MALT.
Processing into malt is an essential step which allows the use of barley grains into the brewing process. In bio-chemical terms: · it disintegrates the envelopes of the small nucleus containing starch chains; · it produces enzymes (diastase) which will remain inside the germinated grains.
Process description.
The processing cycle is completed in approximately 7 days Duration.
Conditions & Effects.
Impurities are eliminated as well broken grains;.
Grain placed in water to encourage germination; Embryo awakes within kernel; Humidity of the grain increases from 12-15 % up to 44-46 %;.
4 to 5 days.
GERMINATION.
Dampened grain is allowed to sprout in contact with cool moistened air; Internal chemical transformations within the grain; "Green malt" is treated with heat / 85° - 115°C Germination process is stopped and humidity decreased down to around 4,5%.
24 - 48 hours.
Conversion factors from raw material.
Approximately 120 to 130 kg of barley grains are necessary to obtain 100 kg of malt (depending on grain quality and purity). The average ratio used is 1,267.
Key processing costs.
The following economic considerations are for illustrative purpose only (European standard plant).

The market for malting barley is rather unstable, with large price fluctuations. Demand for beer, which has been affected by the economic slow down in Asia, Latin America and Russia, should begin to recover as these economies get back on their feet, which provides considerable upside potential for malting barley and malt prices in 1999-2000.

In the past, the mash tuns were made out of copper, but nowadays, they are mostly in stainless. Beer coloration (white, blond - Pils -, amber or brown - Lager -) depends on the level of roasting of the malt used in the fabrication process. The more roasted is the malt, the darker the beer is.
