Graffiti: node labeling in heterogeneous networks We introduce a multi-label classification model and algorithm for labeling heterogeneous networks, where nodes belong to different types and different types have different sets of classification labels. We present a graph-based approach which models the mutual influence between nodes in the network as a random walk. When viewing class labels as "colors", the random surfer is "spraying" different node types with different color palettes; hence the name Graffiti. We demonstrate the performance gains of our method by comparing it to three state-of-the-art techniques for graph-based classification.
