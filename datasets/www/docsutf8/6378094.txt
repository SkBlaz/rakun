Recrawl scheduling based on information longevity It is crucial for a web crawler to distinguish between ephemeral and persistent content. Ephemeral content (e.g., quote of the day) is usually not worth crawling, because by the time it reaches the index it is no longer representative of the web page from which it was acquired. On the other hand, content that persists across multiple page updates (e.g., recent blog postings) may be worth acquiring, because it matches the page's true content for a sustained period of time.
