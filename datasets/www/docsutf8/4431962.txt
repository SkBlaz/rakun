Integrating value-based requirement engineering models to webml using vip business modeling framework Requirement engineering (RE) is emerging as an increasingly important discipline for supporting Web application development, as these are designed to satisfy diverse stakeholder needs, additional functional, information, multimedia and usability requirements as compared to traditional software applications. Moreover, when considering innovative e-commerce applications, value-based RE is an extremely relevant methodology which exploits the concept of economic value during the RE activity. In contrast, most of the methodologies proposed for the development of Web applications, primarily focus on the system design, and paying less attention to the RE, and specifically to value-based RE. Focusing this aspect, the paper presents integration of value-based RE models to WebML models using our recently proposed VIP Business Modeling Framework [1]. We also analyze the framework's potential in linking other modeling approaches, and argue about its significant integration potential with various E-R/OO-based, process aware Web modeling approaches.
