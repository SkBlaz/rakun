Raise semantics at the user level for dynamic and interactive SOA-based portals In this paper, we describe the fully dynamic semantic portal we implemented, integrating Semantic Web technologies and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The goals of the portal are twofold: first it helps administrators to easily propose new features in the portal using semantics to ease the orchestration process; secondly it automatically generates a customized user interface for these scenarios. This user interface takes into account different devices and assists end-users in the use of the portal taking benefit of context awareness. All the added-value of this portal is based on a core semantics defined by an ontology. We present here the main features of this portal and how it was implemented using state-of-the-art technologies and frameworks.
