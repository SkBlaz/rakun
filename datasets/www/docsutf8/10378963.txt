Acquiring ontological knowledge from query logs We present a method for acquiring ontological knowledge using search query logs. We first use query logs to identify important contexts associated with terms belonging to a semantic category; we then use these contexts to harvest new words belonging to this category. Our evaluation on selected categories indicates that the method works very well to help harvesting terms, achieving 85% to 95% accuracy in categorizing newly acquired terms.
