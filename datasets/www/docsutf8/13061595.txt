Domain-independent entity extraction from web search query logs Query logs of a Web search engine have been increasingly used as a vital source for data mining. This paper presents a study on large-scale domain-independent entity extraction from search query logs. We present a completely unsupervised method to extract entities by applying pattern-based heuristics and statistical measures. We compare against existing techniques that use Web documents as well as search logs, and show that we improve over the state of the art. We also provide an in-depth qualitative analysis outlining differences and commonalities between these methods.
