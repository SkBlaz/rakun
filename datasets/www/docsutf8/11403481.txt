Antourage: mining distance-constrained trips from flickr We study how to automatically extract tourist trips from large volumes of geo-tagged photographs. Working with more than 8 million of these photographs that are publicly available via photo- sharing communities such as Flickr and Panoramio, our goal is to satisfy the needs of a tourist who specifies a starting location (typically a hotel) together with a bounded travel distance and demands a tour that visits the popular sites along the way. Our system, named ANTOURAGE, solves this intractable problem using a novel adaptation of the max-min ant system (MMAS) meta-heuristic. Experiments using GPS metadata crawled from Flickr show that ANTOURAGE can generate high-quality tours.
