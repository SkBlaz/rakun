Performance enhancement of scheduling algorithms in clusters and grids using improved dynamic load balancing techniques This paper describes the research work done for during PhD study. Cluster computing, grid computing and cloud computing are distributed computing environments (DCEs) widely accepted for the next generation Web based commercial and scientific applications. These applications work around the globally distributed data of petabyte scale that can only be processed by the aggregating the capability of globally distributed resources. The resource management and process scheduling in large scale distributed computing environment are a challenging task. In this research work we have devised new scheduling algorithms and resource management strategies specially designed for the cluster and grid cloud and peer-to-peer computing. The research work finally presented the distributed computing solutions to one scientific and one commercial application viz. e-Learning and data mining.
