A flexible generative model for preference aggregation Many areas of study, such as information retrieval, collaborative filtering, and social choice face the preference aggregation problem, in which multiple preferences over objects must be combined into a consensus ranking. Preferences over items can be expressed in a variety of forms, which makes the aggregation problem difficult. In this work we formulate a flexible probabilistic model over pairwise comparisons that can accommodate all these forms. Inference in the model is very fast, making it applicable to problems with hundreds of thousands of preferences. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance to existing methods
