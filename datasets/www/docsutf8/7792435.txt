Crawling multiple UDDI business registries As Web services proliferate, size and magnitude of UDDI Business Registries (UBRs) are likely to increase. The ability to discover Web services of interest then across multiple UBRs becomes a major challenge specially when using primitive search methods provided by existing UDDI APIs. Clients do not have the time to endlessly search accessible UBRs for finding appropriate services particularly when operating via mobile devices. Finding services of interest should be time effective and highly productive. This paper addresses issues relating to the efficient access and discovery of Web services across multiple UBRs and introduces a novel exploration engine, the Web Service Crawler Engine (WSCE). WSCE is capable of crawling multiple UBRs, and enables for the establishment of a centralized Web services repository that can be used for discovering Web services much more efficiently. The paper presents experimental validation, results, and analysis of the proposed ideas.
