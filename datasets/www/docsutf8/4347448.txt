Navigating the intranet with high precision Despite the success of web search engines, search over large enterprise intranets still suffers from poor result quality. Earlier work [6] that compared intranets and the Internet from the view point of keyword search has pointed to several reasons why the search problem is quite different in these two domains. In this paper, we address the problem of providing high quality answers to navigational queries in the intranet (e.g., queries intended to find product or personal home pages, service pages, etc.). Our approach is based on offline identification of navigational pages, intelligent generation of term-variants to associate with each page, and the construction of separate indices exclusively devoted to answering navigational queries. Using a testbed of 5.5M pages from the IBM intranet, we present evaluation results that demonstrate that for navigational queries, our approach of using custom indices produces results of significantly higher precision than those produced by a general purpose search algorithm.
