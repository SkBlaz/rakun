SGPS: a semantic scheme for web service similarity Today's Web becomes a platform for services to be dynamically interconnected to produce a desired outcome. It is important to formalize the semantics of the contextual elements of web services. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Semantic Genome Propagation Scheme (SGPS) for measuring similarity between semantic concepts. We show how SGPS is used to compute a multi-dimensional similarity between two services. We evaluate the SGPS similarity measurement in terms of the similarity performance and scalability.
