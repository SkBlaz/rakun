Malicious interface design: exploiting the user In an ideal world, interface design is the art and science of helping users accomplish tasks in a timely, efficient, and pleasurable manner. This paper studies the inverse situation, the vast emergence of deliberately constructed malicious interfaces that violate design best practices in order to accomplish goals counter to those of the user. This has become a commonplace occurrence both on and off the desktop, particularly on the web. A primary objective of this paper is to formally define this problem, including construction of a taxonomy of malicious interface techniques and a preliminary analysis of their impact on users. Findings are presented that gauge the self-reported tolerance and expectation levels of users with regard to malicious interfaces as well as the effectiveness and ease of use of existing countermeasures. A second objective of this paper is to increase awareness, dialogue, and research in a domain that we consider largely unexplored but critical to future usability of the WWW. Our results were accomplished through significant compilation of malicious interface techniques based on review of thousands of web sites and by conducting three surveys. Ultimately, this paper concludes that malicious interfaces are a ubiquitous problem that demands intervention by the security and human computer interaction communities in order to reduce the negative impact on the global user population.
