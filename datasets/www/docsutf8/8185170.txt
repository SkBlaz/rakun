A clustering method for web data with multi-type interrelated components Traditional clustering algorithms work on "flat" data, making the assumption that the data instances can only be represented by a set of homogeneous and uniform features. Many real world data, however, is heterogeneous in nature, comprising of multiple types of interrelated components. We present a clustering algorithm, K-SVMeans, that integrates the well known K-Means clustering with the highly popular Support Vector Machines(SVM) in order to utilize the richness of data. Our experimental results on authorship analysis of scientific publications show that K-SVMeans achieves better clustering performance than homogeneous data clustering.
