Adaptive faceted browser for navigation in open information spaces Open information spaces have several unique characteristics such as their changeability, large size, complexity and diverse user base. These result in novel challenges during user navigation, information retrieval and data visualization in open information spaces.We propose a method of navigation in open information spaces based on an enhanced faceted browser with support for dynamic facet generation and adaptation based on user characteristics.
