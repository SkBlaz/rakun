Consistency-preserving caching of dynamic database content With the growing use of dynamic web content generated from relational databases, traditional caching solutions for through put and latency improvements are ineffective. We describe a middleware layer called Ganesh that reduces the volume of data transmitted without semantic interpretation of queries or results. It achieves this reduction through the use of cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results. These benefits do not require any compromise of the strict consistency semantics provided by the back-end database. Further, Ganesh does not require modifications to applications, web servers, or database servers, and works with closed-source applications and databases. Using two bench marks representative of dynamic web sites, measurements of our prototype show that it can increase end-to-end throughput by as much as two fold for non-data intensive applications and by as much as ten fold for dataintensive ones.
