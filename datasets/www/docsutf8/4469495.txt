EPCI: extracting potentially copyright infringement texts from the web In this paper, we propose a new system extracting potentially copyright infringement texts from the Web, called EPCI. EPCI extracts them in the following way: (1) generating a set of queries based on a given copyright reserved seed-text, (2) putting every query to search engine API, (3) gathering the search result Web pages from high ranking until the similarity between the given seed-text and the search result pages becomes less than a given threshold value, and (4) merging all the gathered pages, then re-ranking them in the order of their similarity. Our experimental result using 40 seed-texts shows that EPCI is able to extract 132 potentially copyright infringement Web pages per a given copyright reserved seed-text with 94% precision in average.
