Providing session management as core business service It is extremely hard for a global organization with services over multiple channels to capture a consistent and unified view of its data, services, and interactions. While SOA and web services are addressing integration and interoperability problems, it is painful for an operational organization with legacy systems to quickly switch to service-based methods. We need methods to combine advantages of traditional (i.e. web, desktop, or mobile) application development environments and service-based deployments.In this paper, we focus on the design and implementation of session management as a core service to support business processes and go beyond application-specific sessions and web sessions. We develop local session components for different platforms and complement them with a remote "session service" that is independent of applications and platforms. We aim to close the gap between the two worlds by combining their performance, availability and interoperability advantages.
