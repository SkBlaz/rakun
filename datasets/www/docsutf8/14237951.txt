The social honeypot project: protecting online communities from spammers We present the conceptual framework of the Social Honeypot Project for uncovering social spammers who target online communities and initial empirical results from Twitter and MySpace. Two of the key components of the Social Honeypot Project are: (1) The deployment of social honeypots for harvesting deceptive spam profiles from social networking communities; and (2) Statistical analysis of the properties of these spam profiles for creating spam classifiers to actively filter out existing and new spammers.
