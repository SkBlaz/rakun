Structured query suggestion for specialization and parallel movement: effect on search behaviors Query suggestion, which enables the user to revise a query with a single click, has become one of the most fundamental features of Web search engines. However, it is often difficult for the user to choose from a list of query suggestions, and to understand the relation between an input query and suggested ones. In this paper, we propose a new method to present query suggestions to the user, which has been designed to help two popular query reformulation actions, namely, specialization (e.g. from "nikon" to "nikon camera" ) and parallel movement (e.g. from "nikon camera" to "canon camera"). Using a query log collected from a popular commercial Web search engine, our prototype called SParQS classifies query suggestions into automatically generated categories and generates a label for each category. Moreover, SParQS presents some new entities as alternatives to the original query (e.g. "canon" in response to the query "nikon"), together with their query suggestions classified in the same way as the original query's suggestions. We conducted a task-based user study to compare SParQS with a traditional "flat list" query suggestion interface. Our results show that the SParQS interface enables subjects to search more successfully than the flat list case, even though query suggestions presented were exactly the same in the two interfaces. In addition, the subjects found the query suggestions more helpful when they were presented in the SParQS interface rather than in a flat list.
