YAGO2: exploring and querying world knowledge in time, space, context, and many languages We present YAGO2, an extension of the YAGO knowledge base with focus on temporal and spatial knowledge. It is automatically built from Wikipedia, GeoNames, and WordNet, and contains nearly 10 million entities and events, as well as 80 million facts representing general world knowledge. An enhanced data representation introduces time and location as first-class citizens. The wealth of spatio-temporal information in YAGO can be explored either graphically or through a special time- and space-aware query language.
