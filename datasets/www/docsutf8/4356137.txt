Estimating the cardinality of RDF graph patterns Most RDF query languages allow for graph structure search through a conjunction of triples which is typically processed using join operations. A key factor in optimizing joins is determining the join order which depends on the expected cardinality of intermediate results. This work proposes a pattern-based summarization framework for estimating the cardinality of RDF graph patterns. We present experiments on real world and synthetic datasets which confirm the feasibility of our approach.
