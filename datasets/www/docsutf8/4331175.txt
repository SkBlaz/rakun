Hierarchical, perceptron-like learning for ontology-based information extraction Recent work on ontology-based Information Extraction (IE) has tried to make use of knowledge from the target ontology in order to improve semantic annotation results. However, very few approaches exploit the ontology structure itself, and those that do so, have some limitations. This paper introduces a hierarchical learning approach for IE, which uses the target ontology as an essential part of the extraction process, by taking into account the relations between concepts. The approach is evaluated on the largest available semantically annotated corpus. The results demonstrate clearly the benefits of using knowledge from the ontology as input to the information extraction process. We also demonstrate the advantages of our approach over other state-of-the-art learning systems on a commonly used benchmark dataset.
