SRing: a structured non dht p2p overlay supporting string range queries This paper presents SRing, a structured non DHT P2P overlay that efficiently supports exact and range queries on multiple attribute values. In SRing, all attribute values are interpreted as strings formed by a base alphabet and are published in the lexicographical order. Two virtual rings are built: N-ring is built in a skip-list way for range partition and queries; D-ring is built in a small-world way for the construction of N-ring. A leave-and-join based load balancing method is used to balance range overload in the network with heterogeneous nodes.
