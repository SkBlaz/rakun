Bucefalo: a tool for intelligent search and filtering for web-based personal health records In this poster, a tool named BUCEFALO is presented. This tool is specially designed to improve the information retrieval tasks in web-based Personal Health Records (PHR). This tool implements semantic and multilingual query expansion techniques and information filtering algorithms in order to help users find the most valuable information about a specific clinical case. The filtering model is based on fuzzy prototypes based filtering, data quality measures, user profiles and healthcare ontologies. The first experimental results illustrate the feasibility of this tool.
