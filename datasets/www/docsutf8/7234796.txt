SPath: a path language for XML schema XML is increasingly being used as a typed data format, and therefore it becomes more important to gain access to the type system; very often this is an XML Schema. The XML Schema Path Language (SPath) presented in this paper provides access to XML Schema components by extending the well-known XPath language to also include the domain of XML Schemas. Using SPath, XML developers gain access to XML Schemas and thus can more easily develop software which is type- or schema-aware, and thus more robust.
