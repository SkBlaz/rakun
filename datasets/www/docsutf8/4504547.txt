Simple authentication for the web Automated email-based password reestablishment (EBPR) is an efficient, cost-effective means to deal with forgotten passwords. In this technique, email providers authenticate users on behalf of web sites. This method works because web sites trust email providers to deliver messages to their intended recipients. Simple Authentication for the Web (SAW) improves upon this basic approach to user authentication to create an alternative to password-based logins. SAW: 1) Removes the setup and management costs of passwords at sites that accept the risks of EBPR; 2) Provides single sign-on without a specialized identity provider; 3) Thwarts all passive attacks.
