Growing parallel paths for entity-page discovery In this paper, we use the structural and relational information on the Web to find entity-pages. Specifically, given a Web site and an entity-page (e.g., department and faculty member homepage) we seek to find all of the entity-pages of the same type (e.g., all faculty members in the department). To do this, we propose a web structure mining method which grows parallel paths through the web graph and DOM trees. We show that by utilizing these parallel paths we can efficiently discover all entity-pages of the same type. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method with a case study on various domains.
