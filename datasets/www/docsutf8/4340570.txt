Adaptive record extraction from web pages We describe an adaptive method for extracting records from web pages. Our algorithm combines a weighted tree matching metric with clustering for obtaining data extraction patterns.We compare our method experimentally to the state-of-the-art, and show that our approach is very competitive for rigidly-structured records (such as product descriptions) and far superior for loosely-structured records (such as entrieson blogs).
