Bayesian network based sentence retrieval model This paper makes an intensive investigation of the application of Bayesian network in sentence retrieval and introduces three Bayesian network based sentence retrieval models with or without consideration of term relationships. Term relationships in this paper are considered from two perspectives: relationships between pairs of terms and relationships between terms and term sets. Experiments have proven the efficiency of Bayesian network in the application of sentence retrieval. Particularly, retrieval result with consideration of the second kind of term relationship performs better in improving retrieval precision.
