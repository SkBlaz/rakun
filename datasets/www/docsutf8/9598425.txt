Near real time information mining in multilingual news This paper presents a near real-time multilingual news monitoring and analysis system that forms the backbone of our research work. The system integrates technologies to address the problems related to information extraction and analysis of open source intelligence on the World Wide Web. By chaining together different techniques in text mining, automated machine learning and statistical analysis, we can automatically determine who, where and, to a certain extent, what is being reported in news articles.
