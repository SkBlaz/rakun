Visualization of Geo-annotated pictures in mobile phones In this work, a novel mobile browser for geo-referenced pictures is introduced and described. We use the term browser to denote a system aimed at browsing pictures selected from a large set like Internet photo sharing services. The criteria to filter a subset of pictures to browse are three: the user's actual position, the user's actual heading, and the user's preferences. In this work we only focus on the first two criteria leaving the integration of user's preferences for future developments.
