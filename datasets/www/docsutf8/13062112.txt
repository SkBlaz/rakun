VoiSTV: voice-enabled social TV Until recently, the TV viewing experience has not been a very social activity compared to activities on the World Wide Web. In this work, we will present a Voice-enabled Social TV system (VoiSTV) which allows users to interact, follow and monitor the online social media messages related to a TV show while watching it. Users can create, send, and reply to messages using spoken language. VoiSTV also provides metadata information about TV shows such as trends, hot topics, popularity as well as aggregated sentiment of show-related messages, all of which are valuable for TV program search and recommendation.
