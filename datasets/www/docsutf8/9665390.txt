Dissemination of heterogeneous xml data A lot of recent research has focused on the content-based dissemination of XML data. However, due to the heterogeneous data schemas used by different data publishers even for data in the same domain, an important challenge is how to efficiently and effectively disseminate relevant data to subscribers whose subscriptions might be specified based on schemas that are different from those used by the data publishers.

Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the data rewriting paradigm and identifies the tradeoffs of the various approaches
