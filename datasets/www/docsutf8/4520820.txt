Learning information diffusion process on the web Many text documents on the Web are not originally created but forwarded or copied from other source documents. The phenomenon of document forwarding or transmission between various web sites is denoted as Web information diffusion. This paper focuses on mining information diffusion processes for specific topics on the Web. A novel system called LIDPW is proposed to address this problem using matching learning techniques. The source site and source document of each document are identified and the diffusion process composed of a sequence of diffusion relationships is visually presented to users. The effectiveness of LIDPW is validated on a real data set. A preliminary user study is performed and the results show that LIDPW does benefit users to monitor the information diffusion process of a specific topic, and aid them to discover the diffusion start and diffusion center of the topic.
