Two birds with one stone: a graph-based framework for disambiguating and tagging people names in web search The ever growing volume of Web data makes it increasingly challenging to accurately find relevant information about a specific person on the Web. To address the challenge caused by name ambiguity in Web people search, this paper explores a novel graph-based framework to both disambiguate and tag people entities in Web search results. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in tag discovery and name disambiguation.
