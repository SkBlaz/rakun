XML-based XML schema access XML Schema's abstract data model consists of components, which are the structures that eventually define a schema as a whole. XML Schema's XML syntax, on the other hand, is not a direct representation of the schema components, and it proves to be surprisingly hard to derive a schema's components from the XML syntax. The Schema Component XML Syntax (SCX) is a representation which attempts to map schema components as faithfully as possible to XML structures. SCX serves as the starting point for applications which need access to schema components and want to do so using standardized and widely available XML technologies.
