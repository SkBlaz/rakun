First-order focused crawling This paper reports a new general framework of focused web crawling based on "relational subgroup discovery". Predicates are used explicitly to represent the relevance clues of those unvisited pages in the crawl frontier, and then first-order classification rules are induced using subgroup discovery technique. The learned relational rules with sufficient support and confidence will guide the crawling process afterwards. We present the many interesting features of our proposed first-order focused crawler, together with preliminary promising experimental results.
