Hierarchical organization of unstructured consumer reviews In this paper, we propose to organize the aspects of a specific product into a hierarchy by simultaneously taking advantages of domain structure knowledge as well as consumer reviews. Based on the derived hierarchy, we generate a hierarchical organization of the consumer reviews based on various aspects of the product, and aggregate consumer opinions on the aspects. With such hierarchical organization, people can easily grasp the overview of consumer reviews and opinions on various aspects, as well as seek consumer reviews and opinions on any specific aspect by navigating through the hierarchy. We conduct evaluation on two product review data sets: Liu et al.'s data set containing 314 reviews for five products [2], and our review corpus which is collected from forum Web sites containing 60,786 reviews for five popular products. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
