Mining contiguous sequential patterns from web logs Finding Contiguous Sequential Patterns (CSP) is an important problem in Web usage mining. In this paper we propose a new data structure, UpDown Tree, for CSP mining. An UpDown Tree combines suffix tree and prefix tree for efficient storage of all the sequences that contain a given item. The special structure of UpDown Tree ensures efficient detection of CSPs. Experiments show that UpDown Tree improves CSP mining in terms of both time and memory usage comparing to previous approaches.
