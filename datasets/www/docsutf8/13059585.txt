Measurement and analysis of cyberlocker services Cyberlocker Services (CLS) such as RapidShare and Megaupload have recently become popular. The decline of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing has prompted various services including CLS to replace it. We propose a comprehensive multi-level characterization of the CLS ecosystem. We answer three research questions: (a) what is a suitable measurement infrastructure for gathering CLS workloads; (b) what are the characteristics of the CLS ecosystem; and (c) what are the implications of CLS on Web 2.0 (and the Internet). To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to characterize the CLS ecosystem. The work will highlight the content, usage, performance, infrastructure, quality of service, and evolution characteristics of CLS.
