Mobile search pattern evolution: the trend and the impact of voice queries In this paper we study the characteristics of search queries submitted from mobile devices using Yahoo! Search for Mobile during a 2 months period in early of 2010, and compare the results with a similar study conducted in late 2007. The major findings include 1) mobile search queries have become much more diverse, and 2) user interest and information needs have been substantially changed at least in some areas of search topics, including adult and local intent queries. In addition we investigate the impact of voice query search interface offered by Yahoo!'s mobile search service. We examine how unstructured spoken queries differ from conventional search queries.
