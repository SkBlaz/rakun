A unified framework for name disambiguation Name ambiguity problem has been a challenging issue for a long history. In this paper, we intend to make a thorough investigation of the whole problem. Specifically, we formalize the name disambiguation problem in a unified framework. The framework can incorporate both attribute and relationship into a probabilistic model. We explore a dynamic approach for automatically estimating the person number K and employ an adaptive distance measure to estimate the distance between objects. Experimental results show that our proposed framework can significantly outperform the baseline method.
