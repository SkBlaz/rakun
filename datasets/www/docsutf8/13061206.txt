Scalable integration and processing of linked data The goal of this tutorial is to introduce, motivate and detail techniques for integrating heterogeneous structured data from across the Web. Inspired by the growth in Linked Data publishing, our tutorial aims at educating Web researchers and practitioners about this new publishing paradigm. The tutorial will show how Linked Data enables uniform access, parsing and interpretation of data, and how this novel wealth of structured data can potentially be exploited for creating new applications or enhancing existing ones.
