structures can be considered further. If the five impact structures are contemporaneous then they would have been generated by projectiles of common affinity. Attempts at identifying the body type of the impactor at Manicouagan and Saint Martin have been unsuccessful; melt sheet analyses yield low to undetectable iridium values26. Initial work on Rochechouart melt rocks implied contamination by a IIA iron meteorite27, but subsequent analysis of footwall metal veins revealed an elevated Cr content and Ni/Co ratios more compatible with a chondritic source28. Small amounts of kamacite and taenite have been reported in the heavy mineral fractions of allogenic breccia from Obolon'15, but their presence does not decisively distinguish an iron from a chondritic source. No appraisal has yet been made of Red Wing. Melt sheets may be poor indicators of projectile compositions owing to the effects of crustal dilution, and depending on the velocity of impact and subsequent mode of projectile dissemination29. It should also be cautioned that the non-volatile components of comets have chemical compositions close to those of primitive carbonaceous chondrites30. Furthermore, because comets comprise roughly equal portions of silicates, hydrocarbons and volatile ices, their expected bulk siderophile contents are expected to be less than one-third that of an undifferentiated carbonaceous asteroid. This may make detection of a cometary projectile difficult. More work is needed to identify the projectile for the five impact structures. Until then, it is not possible to determine whether the source was a comet or an asteroid on the basis of impact structure geochemistry alone. The Norian stage of the Triassic is marked by one or more major mass extinction events. One of these occurred at the Triassic/Jurassic boundary at 205 Myr (refs 12, 22, 31) and is associated with impact-generated shocked-quartz-bearing shale beds in Italy32. This is significantly later than the 214-Myr multiple impact event described here. However, Benton33 has alluded to an earlier Carnian-Norian mass extinction event at 220 Myr, which affected tetrapods and plants on land and certain marine groups34. Unlike the end-Triassic, the age of the Carnian/Norian boundary is less well constrained and it is possible that a 214-Myr multiple impact could be associated with an extinction event at that time. As the late Triassic period is now known to contain evidence for a multiple impact event, a renewed effort should be made to study Carnian/Norian boundary and Norian sections with the aim of locating and characterizing the impact ejecta layer, as well as refining biostratigraphic-radiometric correlations for that time period. The calculated probability of a multiple impact occurring on Earth, comparable to that of Shoemaker­Levy 9 colliding with Jupiter, appears to be low35. This is because, relative to Earth, Jupiter's huge mass presents a formidable gravitational attraction and disruptive force for asteroids and comets. Pairs of craters formed by near-simultaneous impact of binary asteroids are expected for 10% of the impact structures on Earth and Venus36. However, a terrestrial multiple impact event resulting from the collision of several projectiles would appear to require a special situation, possibly involving the close fly-by, orbital capture and decay, and consequent clustered strike of a fragmented or weakly coherent comet or asteroid35. The mechanisms by which such a particular circumstance may arise now need to be further explored. Critical to identifying any additional crater chains on Earth will be the continued precision dating of proven impact structures, followed by their placing on accurate plate reconstructions for the time of impact.

The islands of Wallacea, located between the Southeast Asian (Sunda) and Australian (Sahul) continental areas, offer unique potential for the study of evolution and cultural change. Located east of Java and Bali, which were periodically connected to the Asian mainland, the Wallacean islands could only be reached by

sea crossings. Consequently, before human intervention all these islands had impoverished faunas comprising only species that were capable of crossing water by swimming, rafting on flotsam, or by flying in sufficient numbers to establish biologically viable populations1. Here we report zircon fission-track dates from two fossil sites on the Wallacean island of Flores. Tangi Talo, which has an endemic fauna, dates to 0:90 0:07 Myr BP, whereas Mata Menge, where stone tools are found with elements of continental Southeast Asian fauna, dates to between 0:88 0:07 and 0:80 0:07 Myr BP. Even at times when the sea level was lowest, water crossings were necessary to reach Flores from Southeast Asia. We conclude that Homo erectus in this region was capable of repeated water crossings using watercraft. Tangi Talo and Mata Menge are two of many palaeontological sites located in the Ola Bula Formation of the upper Ae Sissa River basin in central Flores (Fig. 1). The Ola Bula Formation is up to 80 m thick and comprises white tuffs and interbedded tuffaceous sediments underlying fluvial deposits. On the basis of stratigraphic context and faunal content, Mata Menge appears to be younger than the sites of Boa Leza and Ola Bula. Tangi Talo lies 31 m stratigraphically below Ola Bula, and is therefore older than Mata Menge2. At Tangi Talo, a horizontally bedded white tuffaceous layer 30 cm thick contains the remains of pygmy Stegodon, giant tortoises (Geochelone sp.) and Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis). Although angular volcanic rock fragments are locally present, none of these remains have characteristics that suggest

they are artefacts. Palaeomagnetic determinations showed that deposits at Tangi Talo are dominated by reversed polarities but contain two levels with normal polarities. These two levels were interpreted to represent the Jaramillo normal polarity subzone with a date of 900,000 years BP (ref. 2); however, they could also have resulted from the inefficiency of the field demagnetization procedures used on the samples for removing normal overprints held in secondary minerals common in tropical weathering (ref. 2 and C. Swisher, personal communication). The Mata Menge site comprises an 120-cm-thick section of horizontally bedded, white tuff with interbedded, tuffaceous sandstones (Fig. 2, Unit B). The section is interpreted here in terms of the primary, or near primary, deposition of tuff with intruded tuffaceous flow deposits. In places, soft-sediment deformation is evident between layers, suggesting that the units were subaqueously deposited in a low-energy lacustrine environment. The tuff and its contents therefore mainly accumulated from above, whereas the sandstones and their contents entered laterally. These deposits contain the remains of large Stegodon (S. trigonocephalus florensis), crocodile, giant rat (Hooijeromis nusatenggara), freshwater molluscs, plants and rounded volcanic pebbles. In addition, the Meta Menge deposits contain pieces of volcanic rock and chert identified as artefacts on the basis of well-defined flake scars, ring cracks, bulbs of percussion and systematic edge damage suggestive of retouch (Fig. 3) (refs 3,4). The chert flakes are also out of geological context in the volcanic deposits of the Ola Bula Formation and lack any evidence of being transported by water. Of 45 stone pieces recovered in a 1994 excavation (ref. 5), 14 were identified as artefacts according to technological criteria3. Of these 14 artefacts, four were subsequently examined under high magnification and found to have edge damage, striations, polishing and residues indicating use in the processing of plant material3. Further in situ stone artefacts were located in the tuffaceous flow deposits (but not in the white tuff) at Mata Menge during fieldwork early in 1997. The artefacts included a chert flake at the base of the fossil deposit, just 3 cm above the lowermost dated tuff sample. The flake has bifacial usewear, striations and residues. The fossil layer at Mata Menge is overlaid by another 23 m of the Ola Bula Formation capped by lacustrine limestone6. Immediately below the fossil layer are extensive layers of tuff and sandstone, which contain neither fossils nor stone artefacts. Palaeomagnetic determinations undertaken previously found a reversed-normal transition in deposits 3 m below the fossil-rich layer at Mata Menge. The transition was interpreted as representing the Matuyama/Brunhes boundary, and a date of slightly less than

0.73 Myr BP for the faunal remains was inferred2, although a date of about 0.78 Myr BP for the boundary event is more likely7. The palaeomagnetic work did not date the fossil deposits themselves, however. To constrain better the age of the deposits at Mata Menge and Tangi Talo, we collected samples from three tuffaceous horizons for zircon fission-track dating. This method of radiometric dating is ideal for dating young tuffaceous deposits8. The stratigraphic positions of the two samples taken from Mata Menge (MM) are shown in Fig. 2. Sample MM1 was collected from the pink tuff immediately below the lowest fossils and stone artefacts identified, whereas sample MM2 was taken from the white tuff next to a large

B1 is a white tuff; B2 is a light­grey tuffaceous sandstone; B3 is a dark­grey tuffaceous sandstone; B4 is a light­grey tuffaceous sandstone; B5 is a brown­grey sandstone; B6 is a dark­grey sandstone (similar to B3 but with inclusions); B7 is a coarse-grained, yellow­ grey sandstone. Unit C is a pink tuff, which does not contain fossils or stone artefacts. The section around the trench is cut back 50 cm from the main face.

Stegodon tusk. It overlies in situ artefacts. Another sample, TT1, was taken from the white tuffaceous layer at Tangi Talo next to an in situ pygmy Stegodon tusk and pieces of Geochelone carapace. Although the tuffaceous layers sampled may have been slightly reworked since deposition, their horizontal extent as well as homogeneity in colour and texture suggest that any such reworking has been minimal. Therefore, the measured ages of zircons from these units should represent the depositional age of the tuffaceous layers. Analytical results are shown in Table 1. Distributions of the primary grain ages from each sample are presented in Fig. 4. The Tangi Talo sample (TT1) yielded a date of 0:90 0:07 Myr BP, whereas the two Mata Menge samples (MM1 and MM2) yielded dates of 0:88 0:07 and 0:80 0:07 Myr BP, respectively. These closely match the dates previously suggested on the basis of palaeomagnetic determination2, biostratigraphy4 and the presence of tektites9. We conclude that at Mata Menge stone artefacts occur in primary association with Early Pleistocene tuffs and faunal remains. The age of the artefacts also indicates that they were produced by Homo erectus rather than Homo sapiens10. There are several general implications of these results. For instance, today three deep-water straits occur between the Sunda continental shelf and Flores. Even at times of lowest sea level during the last glacial maximum, these straits required sea crossings of at least 19 km (ref. 11). Either there must have been a land bridge linking Flores with mainland Southeast Asia in the Early Pleistocene epoch, or Homo erectus in this region had the capacity to make water crossings12. The impoverished nature of the fauna on Flores throughout the sequence, however, seems to negate a connection with Sunda at any time (compare refs 12, 13). The presence of endemic pygmy elephants, giant reptiles and giant rats in the Early Pleistocene also suggests a continued insular context14,15 both before and contemporaneous with the first evidence for hominids. In fact, Sondaar12 has argued that the extinction of pygmy Stegodon and giant tortoises, followed by recolonization of Flores by large Stegodon from continental Southeast Asia after 0.90 Myr BP, resulted from increased predation, not reduced insularity. More specifically, he says that the onset of hunting by hominids caused the turnover in fauna, a position supported by our results. Our findings, therefore, validate generally dismissed (or ignored) claims for the presence of hominids on Flores in the Early/Middle Pleistocene (compare refs 2, 4 with 16, 17). Furthermore, they indicate that, sometime between 800,000 and 900,000 years ago, Homo erectus in this region had acquired the capacity to make water crossings. Previously, in the region of the Wallacean islands this capacity was thought to be the prerogative of modern humans and to have only appeared in the Late Pleistocene, with the earliest widely accepted evidence for watercraft being the colonization of Australia by modern humans from Wallacea between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago18,19. Outside this region, the technology to undertake even limited water crossings is not clearly evident until much later, at the end of the Pleistocene20. Our results challenge this view. Therefore, this evidence, combined with the geographical radiation of Homo erectus in the Early Pleistocene10 and other recent discoveries21, suggests that the cognitive capabilities of this species may be due for reappraisal.

room temperature to reveal the induced tracks. Thermal neutron fluences were monitored by measuring the track density recorded in muscovites attached to pieces of the Corning CN1 standard glass. Fission tracks in each zircon mount were counted in transmitted light using a dry ×100 objective lens at a total magnification of ×1,600. Only grains with sharp polishing scratches were counted. Depending on availability of datable grains, a minimum of 50­60 individual grains were dated from each sample. Ages were calculated using the standard fission-track-age equation using the zeta calibration method24 and errors were calculated using previously published methods25. A personal zeta calibration factor of 125:5 3 (for P.B.O.'S) was determined empirically using zircon-age standards with independently known ages. The use of the external detector method was particularly important as it allowed dating of individual grains within a sample, rather than relying on a bulk sample age which can contain contaminates. The x2 statistic was used to detect the probability that all age grains analysed belonged to a single population of ages. All three mounts showed a probability of 5%, which was evidence of asymmetric spreads of single-grain ages. Therefore, in each case the `central age' (ref. 26), which is essentially a weighted-mean age, was reported. Data from grains deemed on the basis of their significantly older ages to be obvious contaminants were removed before a final age calculation was made. Each sample contained between four and seven older reworked zircons, which gave ages of between 7 and 14 Myr BP, much older than the primary zircons. These older contaminates also contained significantly lower amounts of uranium (Table 1), a factor that could also have been used to delineate between the primary and contaminate zircons.

Methods

Tuffaceous samples were crushed and zircons in the size range 60­250 m were separated using a Gemini table and standard magnetic and heavy-liquid techniques at the School of Earth Sciences, La Trobe University. Grains were mounted in FEP Teflon, and, after optical-quality polishing, were etched in a eutectic KOH/NaOH melt7,22 at 225 C for 125 h. Neutron irradiations were carried out in a well-thermalized flux in the HIFAR reactor (Lucas Heights, Australia). Fission-track ages were measured using the external detector method23 with Brazil Ruby muscovite being used to record induced tracks. The muscovite detectors were etched for 30 min in 48% hydrogen fluoride at
