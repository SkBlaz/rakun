Monkey Rotavirus Binding to alpha2beta1 Integrin Requires the alpha2 I Domain and Is Facilitated by the Homologous beta1 Subunit
Rotaviruses utilize integrins during virus-cell interactions that lead to infection. Cell binding and infection by simian rotavirus SA11 were inhibited by antibodies (Abs) to the inserted (I) domain of the alpha2 integrin subunit. To determine directly which integrins or other proteins bind rotaviruses, cell surface proteins precipitated by rotaviruses were compared with those precipitated by anti-alpha2beta1 Abs. Two proteins precipitated by SA11 and rhesus rotavirus RRV from MA104 and Caco-2 cells migrated indistinguishably from alpha2beta1 integrin, and SA11 precipitated beta1 from alpha2beta1-transfected CHO cells. These viruses specifically precipitated two MA104 cell proteins only, but an additional 160- to 165-kDa protein was precipitated by SA11 from Caco-2 cells. The role of the alpha2 I domain in rotavirus binding, infection, and growth was examined using CHO cell lines expressing wild-type or mutated human alpha2 or alpha2beta1. Infectious SA11 and RRV, but not human rotavirus Wa, specifically bound CHO cell-expressed human alpha2beta1 and, to a lesser extent, human alpha2 combined with hamster beta1. Binding was inhibited by anti-alpha2 I domain monoclonal Abs (MAbs), but not by non-I domain MAbs to alpha2, and required the presence of the alpha2 I domain. Amino acid residues 151, 221, and 254 in the metal ion-dependent adhesion site of the alpha2 I domain that are necessary for type I collagen binding to alpha2beta1 were not essential for rotavirus binding. Rotavirus-alpha2beta1 binding led to increased virus infection and RRV growth. SA11 and RRV require the alpha2 I domain for binding to alpha2beta1, and their binding to this integrin is distinguishable from that of collagen.

Virus attachment and entry into host cells are multistep processes that influence cellular tropism and can involve sequential recognition of multiple receptors and coreceptors. Rotaviruses, a genus within the Reoviridae family, cause severe gastroenteritis following infection of intestinal enterocytes. The virus spike protein, VP4, which is a major determinant of tropism and receptor binding , is proteolytically cleaved by trypsin into VP5* and VP8*, which increases the virus infectivity and internalization rate . Several glycoconjugates have been implicated in rotavirus attachment . Although a minority of animal rotaviruses, including simian strains SA11 and RRV, can utilize terminal sialic acids (SA) as receptors , SA are not essential for infectivity . SA-using porcine rotaviruses OSU and CRW-8 appear to use ganglioside- and glycolipid-based receptors, respectively . RRV binds sialosides with low affinity via a galectin-like region in VP8* . In searching for rotavirus receptors, Coulson et al. found that VP4 and rotavirus outer capsid protein VP7 contain sequences corresponding to integrin recognition sites . Integrins are alpha/beta heterodimeric, transmembrane glycoproteins important for cell surface adhesion and signaling. The RDGE sequence in VP4 at amino acids (aa) 307 to 310 corresponds to the putative alpha2beta1 integrin recognition sequence DGE(A) in type I collagen . VP7 contains the alphaxbeta2 integrin ligand sequence, GPR , and several potential alpha4beta1 integrin ligand sites . Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to alpha2beta1 and alphaxbeta2, and peptides containing these integrin ligand sequences, inhibited SA11 and human rotavirus RV-5 infection of MA104 and Caco-2 cells, which were shown to express alpha2beta1 and alphaxbeta2 integrins, by 30 to 90% . As Caco-2 cells model small intestinal epithelial cells, this suggested that SA11 could use alpha2beta1 for infection of intestinal cells. Surface expression of alpha2beta1 correlated with susceptibility of MA104, Caco-2, RD, K562, and COS-7 cells to SA11 infection . SA11 showed increased levels of binding and growth in alpha2beta1- and alpha4beta1-transfected K562 cells, which were specifically blocked by anti-alpha2 and anti-alpha4 MAbs, respectively. From these data, it was concluded that alpha2beta1 and alpha4beta1 can act as SA11 receptors . It has been proposed that rotavirus-cell binding can involve initial carbohydrate recognition followed by integrin interaction . More recently, the neuraminidase-resistant RRV mutant nar3 was shown to bind alpha2beta1 . Another integrin, alphavbeta3, has been shown to promote infection by RRV, nar3, and human rotavirus Wa. Rotavirus binding to alphavbeta3 was not detected . It has been confirmed that infection by SA11 and RRV is inhibited by anti-alpha2 MAbs and DGE-containing peptides . The infectivity of several other rotaviruses, including Wa, was also inhibited by anti-alpha2 MAbs . However, binding of RRV to alpha2beta1 could not be detected in two studies , and evidence that SA11, Wa, and other rotavirus strains bind to alpha2beta1 was not found by one of these groups . A summary of the previously published studies of anti-integrin MAb blockade of rotavirus-cell binding and infection is presented in Table . To directly investigate the cell surface proteins bound by rotaviruses, we developed a novel virus immunoprecipitation technique designed to maintain integrin ligand-binding function, which included divalent cations, maintenance of the alpha/beta subunit association, and preservation of disulfide bonds. Using this method, we show here that SA11 precipitates surface beta1 from alpha2beta1-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, SA11 and RRV precipitate two surface proteins with the characteristics of alpha2 and beta1 from MA104 cells, and SA11 precipitates these two proteins and a third protein of 160 to 165 kDa from Caco-2 cells. As SA11 binding and infectivity were inhibited by anti-alpha2 MAbs which also block alpha2beta1 binding to collagen  and as infectivity was inhibited with the collagen-derived peptide sequence DGE , it was proposed that SA11 might bind alpha2beta1 similarly to collagen . Within alpha2beta1, the upper surface of the inserted (I) domain of alpha2, including the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), contains all the components required for collagen binding . Within the alpha2 MIDAS, aa residues 151, 221, and 254 are essential for alpha2beta1 binding to collagen . Echovirus type 1 binds to alpha2beta1, its cellular receptor, via a region of the alpha2 I domain partially overlapping that bound by a collagen-derived, triple-helical peptide . However, in contrast to collagen, the MIDAS is not involved in echovirus binding to alpha2beta1 . It has been reported that the infectivity of RRV and other rotaviruses was increased in CHO cells following transfection with human alpha2 or alpha2beta1 but that the level of virus binding was not altered  . From this study, it was concluded that an anti-alpha2 MAb inhibited the increased infectivity but had no effect on virus binding to the alpha2- or alpha2beta1-transfected CHO cells. To analyze the roles of human alpha2, beta1, the alpha2 I domain, and the alpha2 MIDAS in rotavirus recognition of alpha2beta1, we utilized integrin-transfected CHO cell lines which had been used previously to map the human alpha2beta1 regions involved in collagen binding . We found that infectious SA11 and RRV specifically bound CHO cell-expressed human alpha2beta1 integrin and, to a lesser extent, human alpha2 combined with hamster beta1. This binding was inhibited by anti-alpha2 I domain MAbs but not by non-I domain MAbs to alpha2. It required the presence of the alpha2 I domain but not MIDAS residues 151, 221, and 254. Our experiments showed that the infectivity of SA11 and RRV and the replication of RRV were increased following virus binding to alpha2beta1 integrin on CHO cells.
Cell lines, viruses, and antibodies. | MA104 and Caco-2 cells were propagated as described before . The derivation of CHO K1 cell transfectants expressing human alpha2 (CHO alpha2), the human alpha2 and beta1 integrin subunits (CHO alpha2beta1), the human alpha2 subunit with alanine-swapping mutations (CHO alpha2 D151A, CHO alpha2 D254A, and CHO alpha2 T221A), the human beta1 and alpha2 subunits with an alpha2 I domain deletion (CHO alpha2delIbeta1), and the PBJ-1 empty vector (CHO K1 PBJ-1) has been described previously (, , , -). Cultivation of CHO cell lines was performed as for MA104 cells, except that G418 sulfate (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, N.Y.) at 0.1 to 1 mg/ml was included in transfectant growth medium. Integrin expression on CHO cell lines was monitored regularly by flow cytometry as described previously . Rotaviruses SA11, RRV, and Wa were grown in MA104 cells . For purification by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, virus was grown in cell cultures on beads . Rabbit antisera to SA11 (anti-SA11) and RRV (anti-RRV) were produced as described before  and showed fluorescent focus reduction neutralization assay titers  of 1:100,000 and 1:80,000, respectively, against homologous virus. According to the results of enzyme immunoassays (EIA) performed as described previously , preimmune rabbit sera (control Ab) showed reciprocal titers of <100 against SA11. Hybridoma cells producing the SA11-neutralizing, anti-VP4 MAb 2G4  were provided by M. Estes and J. Burns, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Tex. By fluorescent focus reduction neutralization assay, the titer of MAb 2G4 ascitic fluid against SA11 was 1:40,000. The derivation of antirotavirus MAbs RVA (to VP6), 60 (to a VP7 nonneutralization epitope), and RV-3:5 (to a VP7 neutralization epitope) has been described previously . MAbs P4C10, QE2.E5, and P5D2 to human beta1  were provided by D. Leavesley and P. Simmons, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia (P4C10, QE2.E5, and P5D2), and E. Wayner, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Wash. (P4C10 and P5D2). Anti-human alpha2 MAbs AK7 , which (according to flow cytometry results) binds MA104 cell surface-expressed alpha2beta1 integrin  and blocks SA11 infection of MA104 cells by 50 to 60% at 12 to 40 mug/ml , and P1E6 were purchased from Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., and Invitrogen, Burwood, Victoria, Australia, respectively. Anti-human alpha2 MAb 12F1 and anti-beta1 MAb B3B11 were purchased from Chemicon, Temecula, Calif. Purified anti-human alpha2 MAbs HAS3 and HAS4 were provided by F. Watt, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, England. The epitopes recognized by the anti-integrin MAbs used are listed in Table . The pan-class I-reactive MAb W6/32  was provided by A. Brooks, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Negative control MAbs MOPC21 (purchased from Cappel, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Aurora, Ohio) and RV5:2 (specific to RV-5 rotavirus VP4)  were matched with test MAbs for isotype and protein concentration. Binding of MAbs to cells was characterized by flow cytometry and expressed as the relative linear median fluorescence intensity (MFI), as described previously .  Immunoprecipitation of integrin subunits using virus or anti-integrin antibodies. | Surface proteins on confluent cell monolayers (5 x 107 cells) were biotinylated as described previously , and then cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min at 4C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4C, and lysate protein concentrations were determined using a detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). Purified virus infectivity was activated with porcine trypsin type IX-S (Sigma) (10 mug/ml) for 10 min at 37C. Activated virus (5 mug; 107 to 108 infectious virions) was mixed with cell lysate (70 mug of protein in 500 mul of phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) overnight at 4C. Anti-rotavirus Ab was added to a final dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at 4C, and Ab complexes were collected onto protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) (2 mg in 100 mul) which had been blocked for 1 h at 4C in PBS containing 5% (wt/vol) skim milk powder (Diploma; Bonlac Foods, Altona, Australia). Beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 s and washed extensively with PBS. For MAb precipitations, cell extract (70 mug of protein) was reacted with 5 to 10 mug of MAb for 1 to 16 h at 4C. For precipitation of alpha2beta1 from MA104 cell lysates with alpha2-specific MAbs, MAb-cell protein complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads that had been coated with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Ig) (Dako, Germany) (0.2 mg anti-mouse Ig, mainly IgG, per 20 mg of beads) overnight at 4C and washed extensively with PBS. For all other MAb precipitations, Ab complexes were collected onto blocked protein A-Sepharose beads as described above for virus complexes. Precipitated proteins were separated from beads by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli's sample buffer  containing 5% (vol/vol) beta-mercaptoethanol. Proteins and protein molecular weight standards (Novex, San Diego, Calif.) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 7.5% (wt/vol) acrylamide resolving gel at 125 V. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) for 1 h at 100 V. After blocking in PBS containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 5% (wt/vol) skim milk powder for 1 h at 37C or overnight at 4C, the membrane was washed extensively with PBS-T. Biotinylated proteins were detected by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (StAv-HRP) (Silenus, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), optimally diluted in PBS-T, for 1 h at 20C. Following washing as described above, bound StAv-HRP was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) with ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as specified by the manufacturer, the positions of molecular weight markers were marked, and films were scanned using Adobe Photoshop software.  Virus binding, infectivity, and growth assays. | Assays of infectious rotavirus binding to CHO K1 cell lines were performed using confluent monolayers in 24-well trays (Nunclon, Roskilde, Denmark) as previously described . Harvested virus titers were determined by indirect immunofluorescent staining of confluent MA104 cell monolayers inoculated with serial dilutions of virus and were expressed as the number of fluorescent cell-forming units (FCFU) per well . For MAb blockade of rotavirus binding, washed cell monolayers were incubated with MAbs (200 mul/well) at 37C for 1.5 h and then cooled to 4C prior to MAb removal and virus addition for the binding assay. Rotavirus infectivity in CHO cell lines was quantitated using confluent monolayers in 96-well trays (Nunclon), as described previously . In some experiments, virus was not trypsin activated to maintain cellular integrity. The number of virus-infected CHO cells was determined (using MAb RVA at a 1:2,000 dilution ) by indirect immunofluorescent staining. Rotavirus infection blockade (using anti-integrin MAbs) in MA104 cells was performed using the fluorescent focus reduction assay described previously , and growth curves were obtained using confluent MA104 or CHO cells in 24-well trays as described previously .  Assay for MAb AK7 binding to the alpha2 integrin I domain. | Soluble glutathione S-transferase-alpha2 I domain (GST-alpha2I) and wild-type GST (wt-GST) were produced and purified as described previously , and their binding to MAb AK7 was determined using an EIA adapted from earlier studies . Microtiter plates (Immunosorb; Nunclon) were coated with GST-alpha2I or wt-GST diluted in PBS, at 0 to 500 mug/ml, for 2 h at 37C. MAbs (10 mug/ml) diluted in PBS containing 2.5% skim milk powder and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (Sigma) were reacted overnight at 4C. Bound MAb was detected using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Silenus).  Statistical analysis. | The unpaired, two-tailed Student t test or two-way analysis of variance was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in virus-cell binding and infectivity. Significance was set at the 95% level. Unless otherwise stated, error bars represent the 95% confidence interval and the data presented in each figure were derived from at least three experiments.
Rotaviruses specifically precipitate MA104 and Caco-2 cell surface proteins that migrate indistinguishably from those immunoprecipitated by MAbs to alpha2beta1. | The proteins precipitated by purified SA11 from lysates of surface-biotinylated MA104 cells and collected using anti-SA11 are shown in Fig. . Precipitated proteins ranged in molecular mass from approximately 160 to 30 kDa. Apart from a nonspecifically detected protein migrating at 50 kDa that was present in all precipitations, no proteins were precipitated by control Ab in the presence of virus or by anti-SA11 in the absence of virus. To confirm that the proteins visualized were biotinylated and derived from the cell surface, proteins precipitated by SA11 and collected using anti-SA11 from lysates of mock-biotinylated MA104 cells were compared with those obtained from cell surface-biotinylated lysates . The two proteins of 140 and 160 kDa (present in virus precipitates of biotinylated MA104 cell lysates) were the only proteins not visualized from virus precipitates of mock-biotinylated lysates. Thus, these were the only biotin-accessible proteins on the MA104 cell surface that were specifically precipitated by SA11. The nonbiotinylated proteins of 120 kDa or less proved to be viral in origin, as they migrated in gels indistinguishably from the VP1, VP2, VP5*, VP6, and VP7 proteins solubilized from purified SA11 rotavirus . They were precipitated by anti-SA11 only in the presence of virus and were detected in the presence or absence of MA104 cell proteins. Sufficient viral protein, but not 140- and 160-kDa proteins, was precipitated to be visible on Coomassie blue-stained gels, suggesting that ECL was detecting the large amounts of viral proteins present in the precipitations nonspecifically. This nonspecific reaction was not eliminated by StAv-HRP concentration optimization or alternative blocking reagents (data not shown). Streptavidin can bind to peptides of sequences unrelated to biotin . As shown in Fig. , RRV bound to 140- and 160-kDa proteins was precipitated by anti-SA11 from MA104 cell lysates. As SA11 and RRV share VP4 and VP7 serotype specificity, these antisera can be used interchangeably. Anti-SA11 was used rather than anti-RRV, as the anti-SA11 serum showed a higher neutralization and EIA titer to both SA11 and RRV than did the anti-RRV serum. Consistent with the lower titer of anti-RRV against SA11, SA11 that bound to the 140-kDa but not the 160-kDa protein was precipitated by anti-RRV from MA104 cell lysates . Anti-VP4 MAb 2G4 precipitated virus complexed with both the 140- and 160-kDa MA104 cell proteins similarly to anti-SA11 and more readily detected the 140-kDa protein . MAb 2G4 did not precipitate the 140- and 160-kDa MA104 cell proteins in the absence of virus. Neither protein was detected using MAbs RVA (VP6), 60 (VP7), RV-3:5 (VP7), or MOPC21 (negative control). The 160- and 140-kDa proteins precipitated by SA11 are comparable in size with the human alpha2 (approximately 165 kDa) and beta1 (approximately 130 kDa) integrin subunits  and so might correspond to alpha2beta1. We therefore analyzed the abilities of two anti-alpha2 MAbs to recognize alpha2beta1 on MA104 cells and inhibit virus infection of these cells. MAb P1E6 bound to MA104 cell surface-expressed alpha2beta1 similarly to MAb AK7 according to flow cytometry, as the histograms obtained with the two MAbs used at the same concentrations were indistinguishable (data not shown). P1E6 and AK7 showed similar ratios of the MFI with anti-integrin MAb to the MFI with control MAb +- range (7.23 +- 0.48 and 6.41 +- 0.57, respectively) (data not shown). MAb P1E6 also blocked SA11 infection of MA104 cells by a mean range of 39% +- 7.1% at 40 mug/ml (P = 0.04). As illustrated in Fig.  with data obtained with MAb P1E6, both anti-alpha2 MAbs AK7 and P1E6 immunoprecipitated two proteins of the expected molecular mass for the alpha2 and beta1 integrin subunits from cell surface-biotinylated MA104 cell extracts which migrated indistinguishably from the 160- and 140-kDa proteins precipitated by SA11. Although anti-beta1 MAbs P4C10, P5D2, and QE2.E5 also immunoprecipitated both the alpha2 and beta1 integrin subunits, these anti-beta1 MAbs immunoprecipitated the beta1 integrin subunit to a greater extent than the alpha2 subunit. This is shown in Fig.  for MAb QE2.E5. The alpha2 band precipitated by QE2.E5 is not visible in Fig. , as exposure of the film sufficient to visualize alpha2 greatly overexposed the beta1 band. This is expected, as beta1 partners several alpha subunits, whereas alpha2 partners only beta1. Control MAbs did not precipitate these proteins. Anti-beta1 MAb B3B11 recognized a single protein of approximately 140 kDa, according to Western blotting of whole MA104 cell lysate directly applied to the gel (data not shown). As each integrin subunit-specific MAb precipitated both subunits from cell lysates, a significant proportion of the alpha2 and beta1 subunits in the lysates retained their noncovalent association, which is required for efficient ligand interaction . Although the intensity of the 140-kDa band tended to be higher than that of the 160-kDa band in SA11 precipitations, the 160- and 140-kDa protein bands precipitated by anti-alpha2 MAbs were approximately equal in intensity. This suggests that the alpha2 and beta1 proteins were labeled to a similar extent with biotin and that SA11 may have been precipitating more 140- than 160-kDa protein. However, it is also possible that these differences resulted from the nonquantitative nature of the immunoprecipitation and protein visualization techniques. Overall, these data suggest that the 140- and 160-kDa MA104 cell surface proteins bound by SA11 rotavirus are the alpha2 and beta1 integrin subunits. Possibly, SA11 precipitates free beta1 integrin, as well as alpha2beta1, from MA104 cell lysates. As shown in Fig. , SA11 precipitated a similar range of proteins from Caco-2 cell lysates as from MA104 cell lysates. The exceptions were that a 130-kDa Caco-2 protein was precipitated, rather than a 140-kDa protein, and two Caco-2 cell proteins of approximately 165 and 160 kDa were resolved in several experiments. No SA11-bound proteins were precipitated by control Ab (Fig.  and B). The origin of the Caco-2 cell proteins visualized was determined by comparison of proteins precipitated by SA11 from mock- and surface-biotinylated cell lysates  and in the absence or presence of cell lysate . As the proteins of approximately 120 kDa or less precipitated from biotinylated lysates were also present in precipitates from mock-biotinylated Caco-2 cell lysates and in the absence of lysate, only the three proteins at approximately 165, 160, and 130 kDa precipitated by SA11 originated from the Caco-2 cell surface. These SA11-precipitated proteins migrated indistinguishably from the two Caco-2 cell proteins precipitated by anti-beta1 MAb P5D2 and anti-alpha2 MAb P1E6 . The 165- and 160-kDa proteins precipitated with virus could not be resolved sufficiently to determine which protein comigrated with the 160-kDa alpha2 integrin band precipitated by MAb P1E6. Control MAbs RV-5:2 and MOPC21 did not precipitate alpha2beta1. The protein precipitated by RV-5:2 that migrated near beta1 did not comigrate with beta1 in gels with increased protein separation (data not shown). Thus, the 130- and 160- or 165-kDa Caco-2 cell surface proteins bound by SA11 appear to include alpha2 and beta1. Differences in integrin glycosylation between MA104 and Caco-2 cells might explain the difference in sizes estimated for the beta1 subunit in MA104 (140 kDa) and Caco-2 (130 kDa) cells . In contrast to the results of MA104 cell studies, SA11 precipitated similar amounts of the 160- or 165- and 130-kDa proteins as judged by band intensity. No surface-biotinylated Caco-2 cell proteins were visualized in precipitations with purified Wa. As the maximum ratio of infectivity (FCFU) to micrograms of protein obtainable with Wa (6.8 x 105) was 10- to 67-fold less than that obtained with SA11, it appears that the amount of infectious Wa obtainable was insufficient for detection of Wa binding to lysate proteins. Under standardized assay conditions which included using identical MAbs at the same concentrations, anti-alpha2 and anti-beta1 MAbs precipitated more alpha2beta1 integrin from Caco-2 cells than from MA104 cells, as judged by the intensity of staining of the protein bands. This is consistent with the finding of a higher level of alpha2beta1 expression on Caco-2 cells than on MA104 cells as detected by flow cytometry . The amount of alpha2beta1 precipitated by the MAbs also would have been affected by their specificity for human rather than monkey integrins. N-terminal sequence determination and Western blotting with the anti-beta1 MAb B3B11 that detected beta1 in whole MA104 cell lysate of the 160- and 140-kDa proteins precipitated by SA11 from cell lysates were unsuccessful due to insufficient amounts of protein for analysis.  Mapping of MAb AK7 to the alpha2 I domain and flow cytometry characterization of integrin-transfected CHO cells. | As shown in Fig. , AK7, the most effective alpha2-specific MAb tested for blockade of SA11 cell binding and infectivity (, ; P. Halasz and B. S. Coulson, unpublished data), bound to GST-alpha2I as determined by EIA, confirming previous data showing that AK7 maps to the alpha2 I domain . Flow cytometry analysis using MAb HAS4 (which maps to the N-terminal region of alpha2 outside the I domain [, ]) and MAb AK7 showed that CHO K1 cells lacked human alpha2, CHO alpha2beta1 cells expressed both I domain and non-I domain epitopes, and CHO alpha2delIbeta1 cells lacked the I domain but expressed non-I domain epitopes similarly to CHO alpha2beta1 cells . MAb HAS3 maps to the same alpha2 region as MAb HAS4  and showed the same results as MAb HAS4 (data not shown). CHO alpha2, CHO alpha2 D151A, CHO alpha2 T221A, and CHO alpha2 D254A cells all expressed the alpha2 I domain AK7 epitope . Human beta1 (combined with human alpha2) was present on CHO alpha2beta1 and CHO alpha2delIbeta1 cells but was absent from CHO K1 and CHO alpha2 cells, as expected . We calculated from the flow cytometry histograms in Fig.  that approximately 40% of the CHO alpha2beta1 cells expressed human alpha2 dimerized with hamster beta1. These histograms show that approximately 55% of the CHO alpha2beta1 cells expressed human beta1, as detected using MAb QE2.E5, which is specific for human beta1 and does not recognize hamster beta1 . Thus, the remaining 45% of these cells expressed hamster beta1 only. As detected using MAbs AK7 and HAS4 and determined from the data presented in Fig. , 86% of CHO alpha2beta1 cells expressed human alpha2. So, on average, approximately 90% of the CHO alpha2beta1 cells that expressed hamster beta1 also expressed human alpha2 and, overall, approximately 40% (calculated as 90% of 55%) of all the CHO alpha2beta1 cells expressed human alpha2 dimerized with hamster beta1. As the N and C termini of the I domain are closely associated in the three-dimensional structure and the I domain is inserted as an additional region sitting above the alpha subunit in a subset of integrins , deletion of the I domain is expected not to affect the function of the remaining regions of alpha2 or beta1, and this appears to be the case from our studies.  SA11 rotavirus precipitates a CHO alpha2beta1 cell surface protein that migrates indistinguishably from beta1 and is not precipitated by SA11 from CHO K1, CHO alpha2, CHO alpha2delIbeta1, or CHO alpha2 T221A cell lysates. | Anti-alpha2 MAbs immunoprecipitated two proteins from CHO alpha2 and CHO alpha2beta1 cell lysates (AK7 and P1E6) and from CHO alpha2 Tau221Alpha lysates (P1E6) which migrated at the expected molecular masses for alpha2beta1 integrin (approximately 120 and 140 kDa) . No proteins were immunoprecipitated from CHO K1 lysates  and CHO alpha2delIbeta1 cell lysates (data not shown) by these MAbs. According to the results of Western blotting of CHO alpha2beta1 and CHO alpha2delIbeta1 cell lysates, anti-beta1 MAb B3B11 recognized a single protein, of approximately 140 kDa that was not detected in CHO K1 or CHO alpha2 lysates (data not shown). SA11 weakly precipitated two proteins, of approximately 140 and 120 kDa (Fig.  and C), from CHO alpha2beta1 cell lysates which were not precipitated from CHO K1, CHO alpha2, and CHO alpha2 Tau221Alpha lysates  or CHO alpha2delIbeta1 lysates (data not shown). As shown in Fig. , the 140-kDa protein precipitated by SA11 from CHO alpha2beta1 cells migrated indistinguishably from the beta1 integrin subunit immunoprecipitated in conjunction with the alpha2 subunit by MAb AK7. As CHO alpha2 and CHO alpha2beta1 cells differ only in the presence of human beta1, this shows that SA11 precipitated the beta1 integrin from CHO alpha2beta1 cell lysates. The inability of SA11 to precipitate alpha2 or beta1 from CHO alpha2delIbeta1 cells suggests that the beta1 precipitation from CHO alpha2beta1 cell lysates was dependent on the presence of the alpha2 I domain. The identity of the 120-kDa protein precipitated by virus from CHO alpha2beta1 cell lysates (Fig.  and C) is unclear. It may have been associated with beta1 or may have been viral in origin. As shown in Fig. , the beta1 band precipitated by anti-alpha2 MAbs P1E6 and AK7 appears more intense than the alpha2 band. This suggests that in contrast to results with MA104 cells, the beta1 may be more heavily biotinylated than the alpha2 in CHO cells. This could explain the detection of SA11 precipitation of beta1, but not alpha2, from CHO alpha2beta1 cell lysates.  Binding of SA11 and RRV to alpha2beta1 and infectivity of SA11 in MA104 cells are blocked by an anti-alpha2 I domain MAb but not by MAbs directed to a region of alpha2 outside the I domain. | At a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 (calculated from MA104 infectious cell titers) and in the absence of any Ab treatment, titers of SA11 and RRV bound to CHO alpha2beta1 and CHO alpha2 cells were significantly higher than those of SA11 and RRV bound to CHO K1 or CHO K1 PBJ-1 cells (P < 0.001) (Fig.  and ). CHO alpha2beta1 and CHO alpha2 cells bound 1.6- to 1.7-fold- and 1.3-fold-higher titers of SA11 and RRV, respectively, than did CHO K1 or CHO K1 PBJ-1 cells. CHO alpha2beta1 cells bound significantly higher virus titers than did CHO alpha2 cells (P < 0.01), suggesting that the beta1 subunit plays a role in facilitating virus binding to alpha2beta1 integrin. As shown in Fig. , the increase in RRV binding to CHO alpha2beta1 and CHO alpha2 cells was abolished by cellular treatment with MAb AK7 but not with MAbs HAS4 and MOPC21. Similarly, the increased SA11 binding to CHO alpha2beta1 and CHO alpha2 cells was reduced to approximately 110% of binding to CHO K1 cells by treatment with MAb AK7 but not by treatment with MAbs HAS4 and MOPC21. MAb HAS3 had the same effect as MAb HAS4 on SA11 and RRV binding to MA104 cells (data not shown). Thus, SA11 and RRV bind human alpha2beta1 expressed on CHO K1 cells to a higher level than to that of human alpha2 dimerized with hamster beta1 and this binding involves the alpha2 I domain. At the maximum MOI achievable (an MOI of 1), CHO K1, CHO alpha2, and CHO alpha2beta1 cells bound Wa at similarly low titers (data not shown). Thus, no binding of Wa to human alpha2beta1 or human alpha2 dimerized with hamster beta1 was detected using integrin-transfected CHO cells. MAbs HAS4  and HAS3 (data not shown) had no effect on SA11 infectivity in MA104 cells. In contrast, MAb AK7 inhibited SA11 infectivity in a dose-dependent fashion, as reported previously . According to the results of flow cytometry, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-specific MAb W6/32, which has been used previously as a negative control for anti-alpha2 MAb blockade of echovirus 1 cell binding , bound 99.5% of MA104 cells with an MFI of 20.1 +- 0.5, but this binding did not affect SA11 infectivity, further demonstrating the specificity of the inhibition by MAb AK7. W6/32 also had no effect on the infectivity of RRV and Wa (data not shown). Thus, the interaction of SA11 with monkey alpha2beta1 on MA104 cells is specific for alpha2 and involves the alpha2 I domain. A compari
